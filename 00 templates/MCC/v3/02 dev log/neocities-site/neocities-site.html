        <h1>Dev Log: Mary's Creative Corner</h1>
        <p><u>Status</u>: Active</p>
        <p>Journal-style log of my web dev work behind the scenes. Organized from most <strong>recent to oldest</strong>.</p>

        <h2>October 28th, 2024</h2>
        <p>I finished what I consider the version 0 of this site two weeks ago. 
            I took a week off probably due to burnout and shiny new thing syndrome.</p>
        <p>Today I'm back and highly-motivated.
            My main objective was to made another version of the homepage in a more minimalist style.
            A secondary objective was to decide on color schemes for light mode and mode. Both objectives were accomplished.
            The site is very blue.</p>
        <p>Next, I would like to add a button to switch between these modes but I should test without it myself and see whether it's really necessary.
