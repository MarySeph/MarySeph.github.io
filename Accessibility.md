# Accessibility Statement
Last updated: October 29th, 2024

This website has been designed to be responsible on mobile and desktop. See [[(archived) SitePlans#Stuff to Fix|this page]] for potential accessibility issues.

There are some iframes that I'm not sure if they pose an issue. A search didn't give me an answer on that.

**Disclaimer:** I don't use a screen reader or any other type of assistive device to surf the web. If there's any section of this website that is inaccessible, please contact me. I'm an indie web dev who's learning about web accessibility and would appreciate the feedback.
