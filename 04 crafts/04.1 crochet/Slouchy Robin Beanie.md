## Notes:
Another scrappy project to pass the winter. I made a cat beanie beforehand but I still have some yarn left so I'm making this beanie. I may run out of yarn tho, oh no!

The C color yarn I bought during my trip to Europe last summer. The two balls were on sale because they were all bunched up and had no label. The width and color vary. Very interesting yarn that I had no idea what to do with.

Similarly, the stripe of black yarn is also secondhand. I got it from a clothing exchange were it was used as the top of a beach bikini. It was such a pain to unravel and wash. It sure paired nicely with the other yarn, giving it a gradient of sort.
