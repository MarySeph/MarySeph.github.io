## Materials
- Hook: 5.0mm
- Scissors
- Yarn needle

### Yarn
- A: Red Heart, Value, color Varsity Gold.

## Notes:

### Rules (from video):
1.  Number each yarn ball.
2. Every day, generate a random number (Michelle uses some dice).
3. Crochet using those colors.

### Personal Changes:
Michelle designed this challenge as a stash-busting project inspired by crochet advent calendars. Because I won't have access to my yarn stash during this month, I removed the deadline.

Instead of granny squares, I'm going to make hexagons. I'm basically continuing a granny hexagon blanket I started during the summer. I hope this challenge motivates to use up yarn I don't like and get something useful at the end.

To be honest, I'm not sure if I have enough yarn for a blanket. With however many hexagons I get out of these yarns, I plan to stitch them up with an unfinished granny stitch blanket. Maybe the stitch diversity will make it interesting. I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing, haha.
