## Notes:
In an effort to use up the orange yarn I was gifted, I decided to make some coasters that look like oranges. I really had no other idea on how to use this yarn. It's really bright. I'm making a set of 6, maybe 8, to gift to my uncle who needs to furnish his new house.

I still have another ball of the orange yarn but I may run out of the white. Whatever shall I do? Haha!

I had to modify the original pattern because the orange yarn is thicker. It basically goes from one round of 8sc in white, then two rounds on orange, one round with white, and switch to orange for the last round. It may be unnecessary to say that it's a flat circle with some color switching. 

As for the inside lines, I kind of eyeballed the space between each. I used stitch markers first. Starting from any stich, I counted eight before adding another one, then counted seven, then six three times, and the last would be seven stiches wide before reaching the first marker.

I added the leaves last and I don't actually like the position. I think I will add them between slices like on top of... wait, there's a slice that's too wide, I should add that to another slice so it looks more symmetrical. Maybe something like, 7 6 7 6 7 6. I haven't added the details to the other slices. I think for projects like this in which there are a lot of copies and the pattern is heavily modified, making a test really helps smooth any kinks like the stitch width I just described. Yeah, I didn't have any notes when I made this test, just did it on the fly, haha. Took me like three hours of frogging and retrying. This is when a crafts notebook comes in handy!

Ok, I made some sketches and I'm still gonna wing the 7 6 7 6 pattern and see how it looks. You would be surprised how much math is involved in crochet if you really put in the effort.
