    <h1>2024 Scrappy Crochet Christmas Presents</h1>
    <small>Start date: 12/14/2024; End date: 12/20/2024.</small><br>
    </ul>
    <p>This project will be different from others where I drop a bunch of information about small projects.
        I want to use my yarn scraps for small Christmas presents this year and I would love to document and share this!
        I have bought a lot of yarn this year and I'm actively holding myself back from buying more and using up what I
        have.
    </p>
    <p>I'm working with a limited number of yarn balls I chose to bring beforehand. I have some color schemes in mind but if a color runs out, 
        they may be paired with something that looks a little off.

        <small>Pattern: Modified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I9Tawk1AmA">Spiral Scrubbie by Kushi Crochet & embroidery</a> </small>

            <li>Scissors</li>
            <li>Yarn needle</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Yarn</h3>

            <li>B: Allegro, Tango, color Blanco.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>I love making small items with cotton yarn. I think there's something lovely about getting a handmade every day item.
            I like to make handtowels, dishtowels, and scrubbies, and other household items.
        </p>
        <p>I had this video pattern saved for a long time and I wanted to change the bath sponge I used 
            so I decided to make a test for myself and make more as gifts.
        </p>
        <p>In general, I tried to keep the yarn on the weight 4 category. 
            This an all other projects will be made with cotton yarn.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mix of colors and the strap are the only modification I made.

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            Some people in my family are devoted catholics. So when I saw this pattern from Hopeful Turns,
            I thought they would like this to use while reading the Bibles or something.

            </ul>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            This is one of those yarn which I bought without a pattern in mind and brought me a lot of grief. I love love loveeee
            the colors but they aren't something I would work with to make something for myself, so all the projects I have used
            this yarn for were gifts. Another thing that made this yarn hard to use was that I didn't have anyone in mind to gift
            whatever I made this yarn to. This was a one off use because I bought it abroad so I sure learned by lesson to not buy
            yarn just because!

            <h3>Notes:</h3>
                <p>
                    With this project I managed to use up both of those yarn balls! The pattern called for a 4 weight but I used 2 weights
                    so you can imagine how long this took! I ran out of yarn at the last row so I used up other yarn with similar colors as
                    the base yarn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm beginning to notice that I don't enjoy patterns where small mistakes end up messing up the stitch count. I spent a
                    whole day modifying this patters by half winging it on a swatch and translating it to such a long row count was soooo
                    stressful! The single crochet rows felt like FOREVER but the double crochet rows went by fast. If I were to do this
                    pattern next time, I would use a larger hook and yarn size... Definitely not a fan of big projects made with anything
                    thinner than a 4 weight.... I have much more respect towards people who make sweaters and larger pieces of clothing.
                    It's a commitment.

            </ul>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <p>The final project, good grief! Even after all of these, I still had a good chunk left! I just winged this one, testing
            for size. It's palm sized and I have a strand long enough to feel substantial but not enough to do something with it so
            I'm putting that in the stuffing stash.</p>
        <p>I didn't have a self-imposed deadline but there's other things I want to do during this break and I was running out of
        yarn so I whipped this up out of pure weariness and frustration. I think I'll give it to my brother to use as a
        whiteboard eraser as he doesn't have one.</p>
        <p>I do like how it came out though. I added the borders and the strap with colors Q and N to use up those weight 3 scrap
        yarn. This is quite the Frankenstein-monster-esque project, haha, and one of those cases where one falls back into the
        patterns they know by heart without thinking too much about it. I'm satisfied with the result!</p>
