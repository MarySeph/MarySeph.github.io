# IDH4200 Reflection 2: Everglades Panel

## Reflect on what you learned about the Everglades, their ecological and aesthetic importance, the efforts to restore and protect this fragile ecosystem. Was anything you heard on the panel a surprise to you? What is special about this ecosystem? What do you think about the way humans have first reengineered the landscape, and then attempted to “return” it to wildness? Do different groups of people view this special place through different lenses? How?

I could discuss the efforts and perspecitives expressed by the scientist, policy specialist, and advocacy groups but the segment that struck me the most was the final one by Arsimmer McCoy. It's been less than six months that the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) has come to my attention so I'm fairly ignorant about it. As I listened to the speakers, I was considering becoming part of the many efforts in place as I'm searching for a project to be part to as a way to pay forward the education and life I'm able to lead here in USF St. Pete and the United States. So, what struck me the most about the Everglades wasn't just the scientific, nor political efforts to heal the land and build ecosystem resiliency but those to heal the people that were wounded by its destruction.

I'm exploring the idea that abuse of the people implies abuse of the environment and I think colonialism is the prime example of this. I want to know more about the wound European settlers have left on this peninsula, the land as well as the people, and how does that wound show itself in current times. People have started to make efforts to heal the land but have they done any work to heal themselves of the colonial wound? I want to hear this tough conversations that many Americans seem to have trouble having. I think that if the descendants of those that have harmed and done harm were to have an open conversation, then labels such as victim, abuser, white, black, native, and the strong emotion that come from being vulnerable such as guilt, anger, hatred, and everything in between will fade and they will see each other as a slightly different reflection of themselves. That everyone has been hurt and that the only way to stop the cycle of the abuse of the land is to heal together.

If the CERP, apart from being a world-wide example of habitat restoration for the rest of the world, if it could also be an inspiration of healing from the colonial wound, I think it would reach a great many people who are struggling with a pain they cannot put into words.
