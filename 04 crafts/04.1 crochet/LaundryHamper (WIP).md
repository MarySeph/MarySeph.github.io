Unfinished at the time of writing these notes, this project came to be as a personal challenge. I don't usually buy yarn in bulk nor multiple balls of the same lot. I wanted to make this laundry hamper not only because I felt I needed one; the one I currently use is an acrylic mesh one whose strap has snapped before and I feel it will give out any day. This thing isn't to be trusted. So I wanted a laundry hamper with the same portability with increased durability, no wires, no fabric.

I bought a set of six balls of color A and three balls of color B. It was also Thanksgiving holiday. I gave myself permission to take part in the consumerism culture for once (I didn't last year) but not really but one could make the argument this project wasn't *urgent.* Anyways.

I'm almost done with the bag. I forgot to add the strap to close it, HAHA! I just finished attaching the strap (feels different after sewing all the straps for the new version of the [[Granny Stitch String Bag]]). This is another why having a crafts notebook is VERY important! One forgets things... I'll probably add a picture at the end. For the drawstring, I'm reusing a chord from another bag, maybe.
I just made a new set of notebooks and I'm pretty happy with them.
