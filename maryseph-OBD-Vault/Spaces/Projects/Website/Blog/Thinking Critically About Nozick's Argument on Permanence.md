# Thinking Critically About Nozick's Argument on Permanence

"Ever-lasting," "immortalizing," and "larger than life," these words evoke a feeling of grandiosity. A romantic struggle to rise above the fragility and temporality of human existence to achieve god(dess)hood. The narrative of rising above one's limitations is coated with admiration, hope, and other virtues. At its core, it's the promise of immortality, at least among our peers, but a possibility of extending life longer than its inevitable end nevertheless. Where did this value judgment originate, and what are its downsides? In this paper, I will explain the origin of the idea of the superiority of permanence, describe Nozick's objections against this idea, evaluate his argument, and offer my opinion on Nozick's argument.

The superiority of permanence dates back to Ancient Greece. Plato famously argued for entities called Forms which are eternal and unchanging (2022, Kraut). These Forms were deemed superior to concrete objects because the latter eventually crumbled into dust. Forms are another word for ideas, both concrete and abstract, such as a chair, Justice, Love, an apple, and so forth. These forms are immaterial which renders them indestructible. Because of this seemingly immortal quality, they are superior to objects that can be sensed, death comes for all living things but the transmission of ideas and beliefs across generations keeps them alive. Since then, this value judgment has been applied to human existence, morphing into the belief that a meaningful life leaves a significant trace in the world.

In the article "Philosophy and the Meaning of Life," Robert Nozick critiques this value judgment. He hones into what entails to being eternal, becoming an idea; an abstract, unchangeable existence (2010, Benatar). Nozick believes this isn't the trace people want to leave. A trace that reflects the positive qualities of the individual which is tied to something they cared deeply about (2010, Benatar). For Nozick, becoming an idea means taking a snapshot of a person's life and freezing it for all eternity.

One way Nozick develops his objection is by critiquing funeral services. Specifically, he argues about tombstones and funeral orators. On the former, he describes tombstones are memorials that prevent people from being forgotten. A marked tombstone indicates the life that is not more, an objective symbol of that person's existence. Until that tombstone breaks, crumbles, or becomes illegible, the person's existence can be acknowledged by someone who isn't the deceased, thereby perpetuating their existence by memory alone.

Nozick's objections to permanence as a quality of a meaningful life misinterpret Plato's concept of Forms. Nozick's main conclusion, that to become eternal a human must become unchangeable, is incorrect. If equating permeance to an idea, then it is false to say that ideas are unchangeable. Ideas do change. That is how they live on. They are subject to evolution which is linked to their survival. No idea, even the most hateful, hasn't been adapted by people to the times they lived in. It is because ideas _are_ abstract that, just like people, are mutable. What people lose when becoming immortalized isn't the capacity to change but to change on their terms. By becoming an abstract object, they cede control of this new form their lives have taken to those that remain in this world.

I agree with Nozick's criticism of permanence as the meaning of life, for in the Western sphere, such an endeavor can inflate the ego and encourage a single-minded pursuit of a result that cannot be measured by the individual. I am critical of such a pursuit of a meaningful life for what people are capable of doing with those that have become an abstract ideas. Those that have been immortalized are commonly used for political purposes, some of which cared for only acquiring and holding onto power. By deifying a person, they paint them in a positive light, which by proxy of having them as a symbol, paints political groups as good, leaving no room for criticism, change, or improvement.
