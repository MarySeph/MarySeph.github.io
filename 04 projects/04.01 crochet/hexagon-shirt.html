    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>This is a project that I have been intending to do with a while. Once again, my main inspiration was Michelle Jasek's multiple attempts at improving her own hexagon shirt. Seeing the process on the construction gave me the confident to make my own. So I gathered some references and grabbed some yarn on sale from JOANN during spring break and finally started working on it!</p>

    <p>My first try was a little iffy. I haven't used this brand before and I was of "messing up" so I made a swatch with both yarns with a 5.0mm and a 6.5mm hook with both colors, establishing those good habits. This is the biggest piece of clothing I have done so far so I'm REALLY nervous. The swatches were super helpful. Using the 5mm with color A before making the swatches made me think the tension was too tight but after making the swatches I decided to go with the 5mm with color A and the 6.5mm with color B.</p>

    <p>The swatches where 15 chains plus 3 chains and 12 chains plus 3 chains with the 5mm and 6.5mm respectively. Both yielded four granny stitches per row with 6 rows to reach the aforementioned swatch size. The 5mm swatches where short of 4in/10cm but the 6.5mm ones were closer to size. Because of the blend between cotton and acrylic, color A stretches so I chose to use the 5mm. I'm going to use color A for the first few rows around the armpit and the sides so I want some stretch.</p>
