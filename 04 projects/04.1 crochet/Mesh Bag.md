## Notes:
This is a derivative project from my [[Laundry Hamper]] using the leftover yarn. It's basically the same general pattern without it being a foldable bag. The two main differences are in the straps and the closure. Instead of one thick strap, I'll be making two thinner straps, and in the closure will have an elastic band.

I used this elastic in my [[Crochet Bath Set Collection (WIP)#Head band|headband]] pattern. I really like how it turned out. I forgot that the base was supposed to be larger; I only measured the wheels of the foldable grocery cart and not the body. Amateur mistake. I can't wait to test it out.

There isn't much to say about this project really. I made a base with color A which should have been a bit larger (and I had enough yarn for that). I made the mesh body with color B. Oh, I didn't have enough of color B for a single crochet row after the mesh section. I just went ahead and did that with color A instead. I made so many rows of single crochet before adding the elastic which I just crochet around the next row. Then, I made a final sc row decreasing every ten stitches, just to cinch it in a little more. 

The straps were six chains long, five sc per row. I made an effort to make it short because I know it's going to stretch. Not sure how long they are. Like in my other projects, I folded the ends (up to the fourth row) on each and sewed it together to the body. I think that it makes it look somewhat more... sturdy, perhaps? Then, I sewed that portion to the body of the bag (that could also be why I did that, haha). Fortunately, the sc rows I made were high enough. To be honest, I sewed the straps to the body before adding the elastic. No idea why. Maybe because I wanted to make sure there was enough height. It was just the perfect number.

The only hurdle that I face for this project was how to close it. I didn't have another strap like the one I used for the hamper so I had to get creative. I still have elastic to use for other projects. Oh, and I have less than a ball of color A. Color B has officially ran out!

Final update, I found some issues after using it such as the length of the straps. It was a bit of a hassle to remove the straps but I managed to not damage the top part that was close to the elastic. I gave this project away with the grocery cart when the semester ended. I'm super proud of it and I adore the color combination. It made carrying the cart much more fun.
