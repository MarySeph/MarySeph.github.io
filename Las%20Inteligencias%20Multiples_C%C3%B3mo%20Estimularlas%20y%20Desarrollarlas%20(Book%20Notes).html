<h1>Las Inteligencias Multiples: C√≥mo Estimularlas y Desarrollarlas (Book Notes)</h1>
<h1>üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences</h1>
<ol>
<li>Overview of the Multiple Intelligence Theory by Howard Gardner.</li>
<li>Tips on how to stimulate multiple intelligences in growing people.</li>
<li>Educational, easy to digest, and note down.</li>
</ol>
<h1>üé® Impressions</h1>
<p>I rather enjoyed this book. It‚Äôs a short read that I brought with me for a trip to the beach on February 19, 2022. While I didn‚Äôt finish underlining it on the two hour trip, it was because my mind kept drifting to personal examples and talking to my brother and father about what I read. It made the trip really short and helped me recall various events in my life in a positive way.</p>
<h2>How I Discovered It</h2>
<p>It was in the bookshelf on the other house. One of the readings I was highly interested to take on this year. It‚Äôs my first non-fiction read of the year.</p>
<h1>‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me</h1>
<aside>üí° How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.
</aside>
<ul>
<li>It helped me consider myself much more intelligent than what I already think of myself.</li>
<li>It helped me reinforce the idea that everyone has different areas of expertise, with or without education. It‚Äôs an empowering thought.</li>
<li>Recalling mundane moments without angst did wonders to my mental health that day.</li>
<li>I was able to have an introspective moment that tied to the book‚Äôs topic and see them in another light.</li>
</ul>
<h1>üìí Summary + Notes</h1>
<h3>Logical-Mathematical Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This type of intelligence is portrayed in people who find it relaxing to work on math or logic puzzles, find math easy, and can see shapes in the real world. For example, someone displays this type of intelligence when they notice a pillar or a building looking ‚Äúoff‚Äù or skewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jean Piaget has some studies on stimulating this intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li>The child explores their toys, understand how they behave and what they are capable and not of doing. These limits form the logic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers can include math their classes by going with their students to visit places to understand the math behind them such as supermarkets, markets, and cupboards. Because math and logic is found in the real world, children can developed their logical-mathematical intelligence by searching for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another useful exercice is finding the logic in things or lack thereof, as well as comparing, contrasting, and deducing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In logic, Aristotle‚Äôs‚Äô three statements are important to learn at an early age:</p>
<ol>
<li>The principle of <strong>noncontradiction</strong>.- An object can‚Äôt have and not have the same characteristic under the same circumstances. <em>Ex. An apple can‚Äôt oxidize and not oxidize after being cut.</em></li>
<li>The principle of <strong>excluding the third</strong>.- Median state between contradictory states can‚Äôt exist. <em>Ex. A door can be semi-open and not-open, it‚Äôs either, open or not.</em></li>
<li>The principle of <strong>identity</strong>.- A statement always equal itself. <em>Ex. An apple is always an apple, never something else.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://philosophyresurrection.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/the-principle-of-identity/">The Principle of Identity</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is logic and maths categorized as an intelligence instead of being separated?</p>
<ul>
<li>Howard Gardner cites William Quine, stating that logical reasoning give rise to mathematical conclusions. For example, a cupboard is of a certain height, depth, and allows a certain amount of volume. When testing for example, trying to fit a wine bottle taller than the cupboard, it won‚Äôt fit. Further reasoning leads to the conclusion the wine bottle exceeds the cupboard‚Äôs height, which are mathematical values. Thus, the logical reasoning leads to mathematical conclusions because they are intrinsically linked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<aside>üí° ‚ÄúNewton‚Äôs binomial is as beautiful as Milo‚Äôs Venus.‚Äù ‚Äî Fernando Pessoa.
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Other ways to stimulate this intelligence is with math problems, algebraic analysis, playing chess and go, engineering and architectural challenges.
<ul>
<li>These exercices remind me of 999‚Äôs sudoku-ish puzzle in the warehouse. There‚Äôs a 3 by 3 cube where the player has pins from 1 to 9 and the player needs to make every line add up to hexadecimal F, or 15. The hexadecimal theme also uses this intelligence. Such as the previous puzzle where the pins had to be used in two sets of three to make the digital roots of 1 to 9. The pins can be reused.</li>
<li>I also thing of Legos, using blocks to build stuff. If the architecture is faulty, the structure will fall.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs also brain teaser notebooks made for travel with a bunch of puzzle games.</li>
<li>Sudoku is a pretty good game for this intelligence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This type of intelligence is one of the first I understood I had highly developed.
<ul>
<li>Ever since middle school, I was EXTREMELY good at all branches of mathematic. Before that time, I wasn‚Äôt particularly into math. Hell, I even had trouble adjusting the previous two years. I went to some math competitions and won a bronze medal on a national competition as a middle school freshman.</li>
<li>I also find it very relaxing to solve logic and math exercices. Hell, when I‚Äôm taking math classes in college, doing algebra exercices was one of my favorite parts because I genuinely found it like a fun hobby. Man, I should do it more. Maybe I should buy one of those leisure books filled with fun puzzles.</li>
<li>Additionally, puzzle games are some of my favorite. The Zero Escape series, Professor Layton, and Ace Attorney. Both my brother and I are big fans; I believe my brother likes them because he‚Äôs also high on this type of intelligence. Hell, we play puzzle games at night! And nope we didn‚Äôt suggest that to each other. I can already see some people murmur it‚Äôs crazy XD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Musical Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Music is also one of those that are incredibly important in my life. I grew up listening to music; my dad always put on music in the car and some songs are filled with nostalgia. As a Latin American person, it‚Äôs possible to say that music in my veins. Music and Latin American culture are so interlinked. In the Coast, the traditional genres are about sadness about life and love.
<ul>
<li>I also enjoy playing instruments. In elementary, I tried guitar and followed with the recorder in middle school. I guess I was good enough to be part of a group for some school event. In college, I chose the piano for the first time because I wanted to do something relaxing. I really enjoyed it.</li>
<li>Oh, and I won a scholarship about writing on the meaning on music in my life.</li>
<li>When I learned to play the piano in Fall of 2018, I had an interesting experience with my professor. The first few weeks, I was dutifully rehearsing with the music sheet. I felt my playing was lacking, and one day I decided to listen to the song and practice that way. When I met the professor for our weekly meetings, she asked why had I done differently. I explained to looked up a video with the song (maybe with the piano thingy too) and imitated what I heard. She was impressed. I got praised &lt;3. I learned Vivaldi‚Äôs Spring and other two songs I can‚Äôt recall. I learned that it‚Äôs easier for me to learn music by listening than reading a music sheet, something I always had troubled and never learned properly.</li>
<li>Additionally, I can remember most of the lyrics of the songs I learned years ago. It‚Äôs sort of like a melody, or a path that forms as I sing the next word. Not only can I recall rhythm, I can also recall the time where I was fond of some song. I used to describe it as an emotional imprint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The book described how musical intelligence is mistaken by talent, shown in classical musician who are labeled as ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù and most showed some form of disability such as autism. It also mentions that in Asia, musical education is more prevalent.</li>
<li>This intelligence is characterized with the discrimination between sounds, their timbre, rhythm, tone, melody, and analyzing their properties. Musical notes are equalized with numbers in logical-mathematical intelligence as their form of vocabulary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Naturalistic Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>I had a wonderful time using this type of intelligence in my trip to the beach on Feb. 2022.
<ul>
<li>I was going to take part in a minga and walked around the pools, observing the wildlife. There were many bird species and ocean dwellers.</li>
<li>I observed them and identified their particular characteristics.</li>
<li>There were sand dollars, starfishes, sea urchins, brittle stars, algae, and moss. Looking at the ponds in between the rocks at the seashore was a great way to observe a lot of echinoderms and sea slugs as well as pondering about their behavior.</li>
<li>For example, the sea urchins and brittle stars were packed in small holes at the side of the rocks or at the edges were the rock meets the sand. There was also one brittle star under a rock (that my dad picked and didn‚Äôt put back in its proper place, rude!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I believe that one of the reasons why I find traveling so much fun is coming across new living species. I enjoy taking pictures of flowers, environments, and animals. It‚Äôs just so much fun to observe and note their characteristics!</li>
<li>Other random things I do using this type of intelligence is stopping when seeing an interesting insect or animal, like the beetle on the middle of the street during my trip to Cuenca on 2021 and a pretty purple wild flower growing on an abandoned lot.</li>
<li>I really enjoy observing wildlife. Thus, one of my favorite things is going to green spaces and see what I find. It doesn‚Äôt always happen on trees. There‚Äôs a park nearby with some ducks, birbs, and cats. It‚Äôs fun to watch them too! Also street cats. Fun to watch em too.</li>
<li>I think I‚Äôm good as discriminating between animals. Although that one experiments of organizing wasps we captured was really hard. Maybe it was the stress from being around strangers; I usually can‚Äôt focus around people. Maybe I should have just gone to a quiet place either in the lab or like outside to do the work.
<ul>
<li>Also, I have very little experience finding the name of species. I think I need to practice this a fucking lot and have a reliable source. I have had to identify an insect and had such a hard time because English speaking sites don‚Äôt have South American species. I think a book on local species would be much more helpful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intrapersonal Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>This type of intelligence was easy to learn I was high on as well. Learning about myself was one of the key concerns as I grew up. I couldn‚Äôt handle not understand why I was different so I seeked answers. Either trying to find patterns in my behavior or asking questions about myself. Thanks to this, I know a shit ton about myself I can tell others (although I‚Äôm never sure how much they want to know).</li>
<li>This quest for self-knowledge has led me to build a knowledge library on Psychology, Biology, and other disciplines. I find easy answer hard to accept, or others telling me something about myself before I reach a conclusion. I find others knowing something about me that I don‚Äôt rather frustrating because I have put so much time in knowing myself that my confidence is threatened. Wow, this is kind of a problem. But I think I don‚Äôt pay attention‚Ä¶ ok I do but for other reasons. Yup, I do. Fuck. I guess I‚Äôm not good at tak‚Ä¶ ok no scratch that. Destructive criticism isn‚Äôt worth paying attention to. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ACCEPT.</li>
<li>The book didn‚Äôt have many relevant information on this intelligence nor how to stimulate it or relevant examples. I REALLY wanted to bring out personal examples but I didn‚Äôt find the information relevant on an intellectual or personal level.</li>
<li>I disagree that intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligence are intrinsically linked. Though the later is rather underdeveloped in me.</li>
<li>However, an interesting detail was of the discussion between the personal intelligences (intra- and inter- personal) and emotional intelligence. The definition of emotional intelligence is the capability of identifying, understanding, accepting, and managing one‚Äôs and other people‚Äôs emotional states. It‚Äôs distinctly different from interpersonal intelligence because emotions such as distress are a different challenge to handle. Someone who is good as interacting with others or with oneself doesn‚Äôt equate to someone who can handle their emotions or soothe others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpersonal Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm so low on this. Ue ue ue. Rip.</li>
<li>This intelligence is about how a person understands another. The capacity of relating to others and navigating social relationships and encounters.</li>
</ul>
