Unfinished at the time of writing these notes, this project came to be as a personal challenge. I don't usually buy yarn in bulk nor multiple balls of the same lot. I wanted to make this laundry hamper not only because I felt I needed one; the one I currently use is an acrylic mesh one whose strap has snapped before and I feel it will give out any day. This thing isn't to be trusted. So I wanted a laundry hamper with the same portability with increased durability, no wires, no fabric.

I bought a set of six balls of color A and three balls of color B. It was also Thanksgiving holiday. I gave myself permission to take part in the consumerism culture for once (I didn't last year) but not really but one could make the argument this project wasn't *urgent.* Anyways.

I'm almost done with the bag. I ended up using two balls of Color A and four balls of Color B. ...I forgot to add the strap to close it, HAHA! Okay, I just finished attaching the strap (feels different after sewing all the straps for the new version of the [[Granny Stitch String Bag]]). This is another why having a crafts notebook is VERY important! One forgets things... For the drawstring, I'm reusing a chord from another bag, maybe.

I attached the strap on the wrong side. The mouth of the bag is supposed to be on the inside. I really don't feel like taking it off and reattaching so we going like this till I can't deal with it. The grey strap also greatly contrasts with the rest of the project. It bothers me. But I don't want to make another one so. Yeah! Great project, might fix some silly mistakes, might not. Thanks for reading!

Final update, I fixed the issues! I used it for a couple of weeks and changed the position and length of the strap, it was just too long. I kept the drawstring, I believe. I'm fond of the contrast now. Really ended up loving the result. The hamper is sturdy and the strap is just the right size. One of my favorite projects of the year.
