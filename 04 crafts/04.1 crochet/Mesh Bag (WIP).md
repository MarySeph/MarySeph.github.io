## Materials
- Hook: 4.5mm
- Yarn needle
- Scissors
- Stitch marker

### Yarn
- Color A: Lily's Sugar and Creme, Original, color British Blue.
- Color B: Lion Brand, 24/7 Cotton, color Ecru.

## Notes:
This is a derivative project from my [[Laundry Hamper]] using the leftover yarn. It's basically the same general pattern without it being a foldable bag. The two main differences are in the straps and the closure. Instead of one thick strap, I'll be making two thinner straps, and in the closure will have an elastic band.

I have used this elastic in my [[Crochet Bath Set Collection (WIP)#Head band|headband]] pattern.
