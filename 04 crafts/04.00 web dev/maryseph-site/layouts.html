    <h1>Layouts</h1>
        <p>These layouts were designed using <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>.</p>

    <h2>Version 1.1</h2>
    <small>Coming soon on 2025?</small>
    <p>Designed this around the current layout as of the end of 2024. The main objective was on the desktop version where I
    want to add columns and display the site's Changelog and the latest content as well as some buttons without affecting
    accessibility. And because I have been toying with the thought of improving the mobile experience, I want to add a
    hamburger menu and translate the new design from desktop. Both designs also have a button to change between light and
    dark mode. I'm not 100% sure about it because if done wrong it may affect the accessibility of the site. There is a dark
    mode available if the device is set to such. The reason I want to add a button is because in the two Microsoft laptops
    that I have, turning on dark mode is kind of a pain compared to mobile. In my previous Chromebook and my phone, I can
    set a time for dark mode but for some reason I can't in my laptop?</p>

    <h2>Listfauxgraphy</h2>
        <p>I downloaded <a href="https://kalechips.net/projects/code/listfauxgraphy">Kalechip's version</a> of Listfauxgraphy to test. 
            I have no previous experience with the original Listography (which still exists!), so I made a sketch to get familiar with the
        layout. I'm not sure if I'll use it as a new layout for the web dev commonplace, or for self-care resource, or perhaps
        for the story I'm making or all three. I like <a href="https://summerstorms.me/Thoughts/ListColors">Summer Storms'</a> (previously
        Desert Jaguar) Hydrangea color scheme so I might add it to Kalechips' code. Between the background and color scheme and
        fonts, this code is highly customizable. The sky is the limit!</p>
