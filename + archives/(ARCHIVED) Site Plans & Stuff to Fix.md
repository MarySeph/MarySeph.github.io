### Structure
- Share hubs from small creators in [[Links]] outside of Neocities (ex. self-hosted websites, YT channels, Twitch, Wordpress blogs, etc).
	%%
	- [Rajiv Surendra](https://www.youtube.com/@rajivsurendra) - do you like, no LOVE HGTV and other TV channels/programs on domestic arts? This channel is basically that. bonus points for making me want to become a better human being. sure few online content can do *that*.
	- [shar](https://www.youtube.com/@shar) - digital artist and animator from the Philippines who has some super cute videos.
	- [Abroad in Japan](https://www.youtube.com/@AbroadinJapan) - British man living in Japan who has been making TV-quality travel blogs for about ten years.
	- [AmelieDoree](https://www.youtube.com/@AmelieDoree) - transwoman reviewing Japanese retro games.
	- [Spilled Ink](https://www.youtube.com/@SpilledInkyt) - art channel of two professional digital artists exploring physical art mediums.
	- [ZeldaZW](https://www.twitch.tv/zeldacw) - cozy digital artist who streams while drawing.
	- [nochitamama](https://www.twitch.tv/nochitamama) - Japanese crocheter who streams while working.
	- [youohei](https://www.twitch.tv/yoouhei) - Japanese felt crafter who encourages English speakers to interact. Sings and plays the guitar super well.
	- [Dawn H.](https://dawnahwriting.wordpress.com/) - Wordpress website from an online friend. She's currently revising and posting her stories from her college days.
	- [Lyrical](https://www.wattpad.com/user/exLyrical) - another Wattpad friend. They are publishing quite the ambitious a epic fantasy story.
	- [Mr. Circus Papa](https://tapas.io/MrCircusPapa) - horror comic artist. Their artstyle may be cute but their stories portray heavy topics without pulling any punches.
	- [GBPatch](https://gbpatch.itch.io/) - visual novel game dev studio of the cozy and queer variety. humongous amount of character customization and inclusive dialogue choices in the widest sense of the word. 
	- [Linfamy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkqDNqao03ldC3u78-Pp8g) - YT channels that covers Japanese history and folktales. heavy focus on the female experience and the business of pleasure (which probably warrants a 13+ warning).%%
