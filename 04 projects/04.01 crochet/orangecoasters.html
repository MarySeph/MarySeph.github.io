    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hook: 6.5mm (main body), 5.0mm (white details), & 3.5mm (leaves)</li>
        <li>Scissors</li>
        <li>Yarn needle</li>
        <li>Stitch markers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Yarn</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A: Unknown yarn, color Orange.</li>

        <li>C: Allegro, Vals, color 8/6 Verde.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>In an effort to use up the orange yarn I was gifted, I decided to make some coasters that look like oranges.I really had
    no other idea on how to use this yarn. It's really bright. I'm making a set of 6, maybe 8, to gift to my uncle who needs
    to furnish his new house.</p>
    <p>I still have another ball of the orange yarn but I may run out of the white. Whatever shall I do? Haha!</p>
    <p>I had to modify the original pattern because the orange yarn is thicker. It basically goes from one round of 8sc in
    white, then two rounds on orange, one round with white, and switch to orange for the last round. It may be unnecessary
    to say that it's a flat circle with some color switching.</p>
    <p>As for the inside lines, I kind of eyeballed the space between each. I used stitch markers first. Starting from any
    stich, I counted eight before adding another one, then counted seven, then six three times, and the last would be seven
    stitches wide before reaching the first marker.</p>
    <p>I added the leaves last and I don't actually like the position. I think I will add them between slices like on top of...
    wait, there's a slice that's too wide, I should add that to another slice so it looks more symmetrical. Maybe something
    like, 7 6 7 6 7 6. I haven't added the details to the other slices. I think for projects like this in which there are a
    lot of copies and the pattern is heavily modified, making a test really helps smooth any kinks like the stitch width I
    just described. Yeah, I didn't have any notes when I made this test, just did it on the fly, haha. Took me like three
    hours of frogging and retrying. This is when a crafts notebook comes in handy!</p>
    <p>Ok, I made some sketches and I'm still gonna wing the 7 6 7 6 pattern and see how it looks. You would be surprised how
    much math is involved in crochet if you really put in the effort.</p>
