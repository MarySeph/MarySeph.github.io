    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>So, if you have read about <a href="/04 projects/04.01 crochet/hexagon-shirt.html">this fiasco</a> you may be wondering, "Mary, what are you going to do with the yarn?" Well, thanks for asking! That's what this project was for!</p>
    <p>So, they day before I returned to my parents' house, they bought a dresser for my mom. It looked pretty plain so I found a pattern to make a simple table runner for it! This pattern was such a yarn eater, I probably used one whole ball! It was just what I wanted. I even added the tassels! Such an elegant pattern. I would make more if tables didn't get dirty in this house. The pattern wasn't really hard in any way after I got the grasp on it. Which was after frogging to add the depressions to make a zig zag instead of a V-shape, HAHA! It was nice to learn something new. Gosh, I love staring at it! It took me a few days to choose to add the tassels, otherwise, I would say this took me about a few hours without counting messing up the pattern and reducing the length (more frogging yes).</p>
    <blockquote>I haven't been keeping notes so the start and end dates may not be accurate. It was probably done in 2025, early June.</blockquote>
