Oh my, oh my, am I glad to be back tweaking this site! I chose to put this site aside to focus on my studies and I'm proud to inform that after doing an internship, this enby will be the owner of a Bachelor degree! In Environmental Science! Woohoo! Haha.

I've been back home for a almost three weeks and I'm getting my groove back. I returned from my trip to the capital a couple of days ago and I'm enjoying my birthday updating this site and doing crafts.

I have been reading about git flows with the intention of applying some to my workflow. As a self-taught front-end web developer working solo, I want to take my expertise with git to the next level. With workflows, I'll be handling branches, making pull requests and overall getting a deeper understanding of this tool. Here the original [post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) from Vincent Driessen, here's [another post](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/) based on it, and here's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW6dFpTMk8s) on Git Flow and GitHub Flow.

At the moment, I find that GitHub Flow works better for solo projects such a personal websites because its a faster workflow than Git Flow which relies on more branches and assumes a longer development period. One of the things that I want to polish from my current workflow is the process from the website's content which is currently under the `markdown` branch to the HTML/CSS syntax. I don't mind copy and pasting but I have had trouble remembering what I need to copy. I want to introduce more discipline into my workflow going directly from MD draft to HTML/CSS syntax and not get distracted from writing/editing other things.

Overall, I'm doing pretty well. I have applied to an internship and I'm waiting for an answer. If that doesn't work out, I have a few ideas. I'm planning on finishing a little project called [LinkFree](https://maryseph.github.io/MariaJoseRuiz-LinkFree/) which is a self-coded version of LinkTree. I'm not sure if there's an official name for one page websites with links to different accounts of an individual/entity but that's what it is. I just need to add the rest of the icons, fix the link to my CV, and add the credits section. The link to the portfolio is a placeholder till I get to that project.

On a random final note, I got into a customizing kick and set up Rainmeter and TranslucentTB, and designed my own aesthetic desktop background for my laptop. It's the first time I have done something like this to my devices and I'm happy with the result. I always had trouble deciding on a desktop background so a productivity-focused one was just what I needed, haha. It got the time and date in the center, a monthly calendar, a weather widget, and several drawers for most used app, projects, and a priority list similar to what's at the top of the page. This totally wasn't to scratch the web dev itch while procrastinating on homework, not at all.

Welp, here's to more updates to come! Cheers!

Whoop whoop, what a strange place to be! The home of this site has been neocities for the past four months. While I'm writing on the markdown version, I'm updating this site, from [Github Pages](https://maryseph.github.io/)! Not gonna lie, it feels much more lonely. But as I explained [[Social Media Presence Cleanup|here]], one of the goals from starting my own website was to make it slightly more professional. The kind of website I can share with people in real life and is tied to my... government identity I guess, for lack of a better term.

To summarize that behemoth of a page, what's going to happen from now on is that this site will continue to be hosted on GitHub Pages. That means the site in Neocities will not be updated. That's all you need to know. Welcome to MY site! A slightly less self-indulgent than the previous one. Look forward to big-brained arguments. I'm going full PKM with this one and there's no turn back.

## January 5th, 2025
Wow, WOW! We actually made it. The celebration was so exciting. Nothing to complain about. I managed to write things I wanted to leave behind and share this opportunity with my family and burned all those papers with the mannequins on New Year's Day (the law-abiding pyromaniac in me was ecstatic). The food was delicious. I received a lovely dotted notebook. Despite having a severe toothache, I feel light.

Website-wise, I'm testing things behind the scenes like Kalechips' lisfauxgraphy code (take a look at the [web dev commonplace notebook!](https://maryseph.neocities.org/02%20web%20dev/neocities-site/alt-webdev-common/catch-all)). I'm making a list of creatives outside of web dev who have added some value to my life to add them to [[Links]].

On another topic, I finally took the leap to use extensions to keep myself accountable on what sites I spend the most time on my laptop. My phone has the Digital Wellbeing app and YourHour to limit the use of some apps. I wanted to bring that same mindfulness to my laptop. I am using [Unhook](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid) and [Superfocus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/superfocus-time-tracker-b/dboceidahklphhjpfbpnicodnbkoiokn/reviews). The former is specifically for YT, hiding sections like Shorts, Mixes, Recommended, and Live Chat. Superfocus tackles a wider range of addictive social media apps. At the moment, it hides my YT Feed which is such a crazy change. Now I just have the Subscriptions page to watch content. This is doing something to my brain I don't know how to express. I'm definitely spending less time on the site which I'm putting on other places that are more meaningful (like this site!), or checking out older content from people I follow.

Back to website stuff, I like having different things for the site to work on. [[Site Plans]] is divided into Structure, Design, Both, and Others so I have quite the breadth of things to tackle whenever I feel like and the site still feels "whole" (although the relative sizes are still screaming at me because the text looks HUGE on mobile but I dread CSS so I'm procrastinating hard on that). I decided to add the stuff I'm focusing one on the "Developing" section so I don't get overwhelmed/confused, haha.

 Been a few days home. The weekend was eventful, in a good way. Wondering whether to make a manifesto of sorts about the web design values I want to follow in this site. I have been wanting to add a lot of cute things to my site and I don't know from what point indie web stuff is inaccessible so I feel like I need a guide before making big changes to this site for the sake of aesthetics.

I'm working on crocheting Christmas presents with the scrap yarn I brought from my stash. I also redid a hand towel. Still need to make some bookmarks and I don't know what else after that.

Apart from developing this site, I have enough things to keep me mentally stimulated which is always a concern for me during the holidays. I'm heading to my last semester in college so there's some things I need to prepare for. Pre-prepare? Haha.

## December 12th, 2024
The end of a college semester is such a strange time. I feel out of sorts those last few days.

I'm heading back home tomorrow for winter break. Lots of exciting things to come. My brother's birthday, family reunions, Christmas, New Years's, and possibly a trip within the trip.

I have been traveling a lot the past year and I have noticed how the day before I'm mostly... not present? Like my body is preparing for traveling (which is a stressful endeavor) and I don't feel like doing much. So I'm here, editing my website with two things left to pack.

I'm not sure if this last week I haven't felt compelled to get up because of the anxiety of finals and the trip, compared to the excitement of waking up and doing things I enjoy. I hope the feeling goes away once I don't have to stressed about missing a flight. This is where keeping up an analog commonplace notebook or a journal would help a lot. Just writing down whatever comes to mind declutters it. I found [nice video about this actually](https://youtu.be/2-cyLX2eAn0?si=PO8ZlKzsXAeiIjg1) by Rajiv Surendra.

Now that I think about it, this feeling does remind me of liminality. I just want to be home. I feel like I'm neither in my dorm as I start to pack nor am I at my parent's house. I felt this a lot during the summer when I was traveling all around Europe and a lot of days it was a struggle to function. Everything went just fine, barely missed trains and flights but I couldn't focus on doing anything "serious" when the biggest concern in my head was to catch that transport. This is a common experience? Why do I feel like I should be doing anything else? I'm asking too much for myself, clearly. I already became ahead of things. Ahhhhhh, is it a hustle mindset?*sigh*. I need some self-care. Thanks for reading this ramble. Looking forward to the holiday season for that good 30C and higher tropical heat.

Man, you know what? I'm going to work on the Crafts page and maybe that other story of the ocean-theme fish-loving boy. I have two stories I want to at least make a note that they are top of mind and gotta update that site plans! Aaaaand, done! Feeling much better! Note to self: make freestyle journaling a priority next year. I like to type!

## October 28th, 2024
Decided to take the site's ethos to a more minimalistic, writing-centered approach. I'm working on a new layout with light and dark modes.

## October 19, 2024

This past couple of weeks have been *hectic*. From a 180 change in environment to the looming end to this mock vacation, I don't know what's going on anymore.

It's been great though! Cohost is gone and I made this website which feels like a natural development of my growing interest in the indie web. I want to get better at front-end web development because it aligns with my professional goals and values, and I wanted to create a space to share my creative hobbies.
