    <h1>06.26.2024</h1>
    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>It's been a while since the last update. I'm not mentioning the time lag because I feel pressured to update. It's
        because I <i>had</i> an update to write but I hadn't written it.</p>
    <p>There's a recent trend in my life to sort of knock down the confidence I have built regarding the skills I have
        been
        developing. I find this to be a positive thing because it keeps me humble.</p>
    <p>So, what's the latest news then? Oh god, it's so embarrassing to write. I left off the decision to use the tools
        I was
        somewhat comfortable with to build the website. After that, I had the bright idea of working on the website's
        structure
        in TiddlyWiki/Blink. And I don't know why that was a good idea. The previous <a
            href="https://maryseph.github.io/Happiness-The-Meaning-of-Life-A-Philosophy-Mind-Garden/">mind
            garden</a> taught me to build the content and then the website.</p>
    <p>I got arrogant. I didn't listen which led to many hours wasted.</p>
    <p>I got arrogant because as a side project of that mind garden, I made a template. Because I have that template, I
        thought
        building the website's structure was gonna be easy-peasy.</p>
    <p>It wasn't.</p>
    <p>I still don't know why it wasn't working at all.</p>
    <p>So, lesson learned. Focus on the content of the website and <strong><i>THEN</i></strong> the website itself.</p>
    <p>What I <i>should</i> have done was gather the content I wanted to add to the website. Make a draft structure of
        sorts in the
        same software I made the mind garden, Obsidian, and transfer all the content to the TiddlyWiki/Blink file and
        build the
        structure from there.</p>
    <p>I mentioned a trend at the beginning because this exercise in humility is similar to what I experienced in my
        recent
        trip around Europe in regards to the train system. The more I traveled, the more confidence I got in being able
        to
        navigate the system. However, that confidence exploded to bits the moment I arrived in another country, usually
        speaking
        a language I didn't know. I got lost countless times until I found my way. Truly, the most arrogant thing I
        could say
        when recounting this trip is that I'm an expert in navigating the European train systems.</p>
    <p>Ha! I'm not. I'm the one who's most aware of it.</p>
    <p>The lesson here is that no matter the amount of experience I have built around a skill, there will always be
        something I
        don't know. There's always something new to learn, and if I want to develop as a human being, I need to be open
        to the
        possibility of being ignorant and wrong. They aren't something I should be ashamed of but part of life. Their
        moral
        quality is null. Thus, there's no reason to be ashamed or frustrated. Those emotions are part of the experience.
        Because
        I acknowledge I feel those things, it means I was overconfident which was a silly human thing to do.</p>
    <p>Learn from tripping up over your own feet. Stand up, dust yourself off, and keep moving. One foot in front of the
        other
        will get you places you cannot even imagine. I think that's one of the beautiful things about life.</p>
