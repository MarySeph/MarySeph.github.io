Unfinished at the time of writing these notes, this project came to be as a personal challenge. I don't usually buy yarn in bulk nor multiple balls of the same lot. I wanted to make this laundry hamper not only because I felt I needed one; the one I currently use is an acrylic mesh one whose strap has snapped before and I feel it will give out any day. This thing isn't to be trusted. So I wanted a laundry hamper with the same portability with increased durability, no wires, no fabric.

I bought a set of six balls of color A and three balls of color B. It was also Thanksgiving holiday. I gave myself permission to take part in the consumerism culture for once (I didn't last year) but not really but one could make the argument this project wasn't *urgent.* Anyways.

I'm almost done with the bag. I ended up using two balls of Color A and four balls of Color B. ...I forgot to add the strap to close it, HAHA! Okay, I just finished attaching the strap (feels different after sewing all the straps for the new version of the [[Granny Stitch String Bag]]). This is another why having a crafts notebook is VERY important! One forgets things... For the drawstring, I'm reusing a chord from another bag, maybe.

I attached the strap on the wrong side. the mouth of the bag is supposed to be on the inside. I really don't feel like taking it off and reattaching so we going like this till I can't deal with it. The grey strap also greatly contrasts with the rest of the project. It bothers me. But I don't want to make another one so. Yeah! Great project, might fix some silly mistakes, might not. Thanks for reading!
