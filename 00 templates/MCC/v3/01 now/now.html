        <h1>Now</h1>
        <p>this page is about what I'm up to right <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">meow</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Reading: </strong>Crime and Punishment.<br>
                <strong>Watching: </strong>a bunch of on-going series.<br>
                <strong>Making: </strong>Jellyfish.<br>
                <strong>Developing: </strong>This site.<br>
                <strong>Learning: </strong>college courses.<br>
                <strong>Feeling: </strong>Anxious and stressed.<br>
                </p>
        <h2>October 28th, 2024</h2>
        <p>Decided to take the site's ethos to a more minimalistic, writting-centered approach. 
            I'm working on a new layout with light and dark modes. </p>
        
        <h2>October 19, 2024</h2>
        <p>This past couple of weeks have been <i>hectic.</i>From a 180 change in environment to the looming end to this mock vacation, I don't know what's going on anymore.</p>
        <p>It's been great though! Cohost is gone and I made this website which feels like a natural development of my growing interest in the indie web. 
            I want to get better at front-end web development because it aligns with my professional goals and values, and I wanted to create a space to share my creative hobbies.</p>
