# My First Digital Garden, A Web Development Project 

I think for this first mind garden, I'll start small. I'll use a batch of notes with a common theme and publish them. It could be #thoughts_on or #media_notes. I'm passionate about both and some even overlap, haha. Maybe they are even the same thing. 

These are the chosen ones:

~~1. [[Thoughts on SSMY OVA]]
2. [[Spaces/Projects/Evernote Migration/Successful/Thoughts on SSMY Volume 8]]
3. [[2020 ðŸ“º Link Click]]
4. [[2020 ðŸ“º Ousama Ranking]]
5. [[2021 ðŸŽ¥ Encanto (Disney Movie)]]
6. [[2020 ðŸ“º Moriarty the Patriot]]
7. [[2019 ðŸ“º Stars Align]]
8. [[2018 ðŸ“º The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation]]~~

These are not interlinked, whoops. Yeah, that was the problem I ran in [Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/product). Does it matter? Yes, it does. Why? Because I want to use the bi-directional linking feature. It's very important. It's what makes a digital garden so fun to use. It's like a snapshot of the person's thinking model. I should at least link these notes. Somehow.

I think I can link the SSMY ones. Best case scenario, I can use all the SSMY notes.

The topic of this mind garden needs to be something I'm passionate about. A digital garden is similar to a blog, but it's not as polished. I'm sure I have content that could become a digital garden. Going meta would be [so confusing](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-Vault-main&file=%E2%80%A2%20Inbox%2FNew%20Ideas%2FSelf-hosting%20my%20Digital%20Garden%20with%20Github%2C%20and%20perhaps%20Tiddlywiki).

Another option is to make a digital garden of my current story. It's like homework. You need to choose a topic and make a digital garden out of it. Actually, that sounds quite nice.

**Choose a theme and make a digital garden out of it. This is important homework. You have three days. Have it by Friday.**

Actually, I already have it. It's [[Obsidian Demo-v2.5]] on GitHub.
- Deploy through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Host repo on [GithubPages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
- [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted) for back end and appearance and generating the static website (HTML and CSS)
- Features:
	**- Bi-directional linking**
	~~- Hover pop-ups~~
	- Name
	- Central index (https://www.gwern.net/index)
	~~- Visual node graph (https://wiki.nikiv.dev/); [[Obsidian]]~~

Based on [Maggie Appleton's post](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), your digital garden can have these qualities:
1. pages are linked through a connection of ideas, not by date.
	- No "Most recent" or "Latest" feed at index
		- optional:
			- Central index (https://www.gwern.net/index)
			- Search bar
			- Visual node graph (https://wiki.nikiv.dev/); [[Obsidian]]
2. room for growth and development
3. learn in public, you are a novice
	- optional metadata:
		- topics
		- dates (created and last edited)
		- stage (seedling, budding, evergreen)
4. personal and experimental
5. diverse types of content
	- text
	- tweets ^a95964
	- images
	- videos
	- audio
	- etc
6. you must own it
	- use open-source software
		- Github
		- Jekyll
		- Hugo
		- etc
	- web native languages
		- HTML
		- CSS
		- Markdown
