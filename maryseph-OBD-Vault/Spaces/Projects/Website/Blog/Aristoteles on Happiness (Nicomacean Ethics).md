# Aristoteles on Happiness (Nicomacean Ethics)

Hope is the fuel of the human spirit. Hope for a better future, hope for a better life. The roots of this ideal, like many others, are found in ancient times. In the Western world, much of that influence stems from Ancient Greece and its colorful cast of thinkers. Among them, Aristoteles thought and wrote extensively on the subject. Aristoteles, in his seminal work Nicomacean Ethics, proposes that the highest good (_summun bonum_) consists in a good life (_eudaimonia_) which is the end of all human endeavor. He argues that a good life can be achieved by performing virtuous actions across a lifetime. This moral philosophy is known as Virtue Theory.

 Aristoteles begins by considering the purpose of human activities. He states that actions are undertaken for a goal. For example, people work to have enough money to pay for essentials and so on. In other words, there is a sequence of goals that guide human actions. Therefore, there is an ultimate goal that guides all human actions (Aristoteles, 2011).

Seeking the form of this ultimate goal—highest good—Aristoteles turns to his peers. There is a uniform agreement that a good life, eudaimonia, is such (Aristoteles, 2011). Eudaimonia, for Aristoteles, satisfies three conditions for the highest good. One, a good life is desired for its own sake; the end is itself. Two, all other things are desired for its sake; there are ends that come before it. Three, it's not desired for the sake of something else; there is no other end that follows. With this revelation, Aristoteles follows to discuss the good life.

Aristoteles believes that a good life consists in performing one's function virtuously across a lifetime. He asserts that the function of a human is to reason, and it must be done virtuously to inform the actions throughout life. This implies that, happiness is achieved after death if others conclude so (Aristoteles, 2011). Formed as an argument, Aristoteles says that "If the highest good(x) leads to a good life(y) and performing one's function(z) is the highest good(x), then performing one's function(z) leads to a good life(y)." The rest of the books builds the moral theory based on the concept of virtue. Virtue is the Golden Mean between extremes of deficiency and excess. Aristoteles states that the virtuous action between the extremes can be discovered through reason.

Aristoteles' Function Argument limits the value of human life to the capacity to perform a specific function. In this second half, I propose one objection and propose an alternative way to achieve a good life.

 While I support the intent behind the conclusion—that reasoning ought to inform our actions, I do not consider reasoning to be the function of a human in which their moral value rests. Arguing that the value of a shoemaker rests on the quality of their products diminishes their life. Work doesn't give value to people. People ought to neither live for work, not work to live. Furthermore, this argument makes "a good life" unavailable to many people, particularly those with few financial resources. This perspective encourages thought of deficiency and elevates material greed.

 Thus, I propose that a good life is both an achievable and sustainable goal. A good life should consider the community. In addition, it cannot be a psychological state, for people are prone to errors in judgement. Through Utilitarianism—a moral theory that aims to bring the greatest amount of good to the greatest number of people (Crash Course, 2017)—a good life become an objective judgement that values interpersonal relationships, non-material well-being, and the pleasure and pain of those involved. Thus, a good life could be one of harmonious relations where people care about each other's well-being and are active participants in the health of oneself, others, and the community. This can also extend to the well-being of other-than-human members such as pets and local wildlife, and even non-sentient beings like infrastructure.
