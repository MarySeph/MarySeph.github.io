MASSIVE update! [[Crafts]] and [Guestbook](https://maryseph.atabook.org/) in the nav bar are now available. With this, all items in the nav now lead to somewhere! In the crafts page, I added some WIPs. The guestbook is made with atabook.org. I also added a visitor counter, a clap button, and two stickers to the main page. Last but not least, I resized the iframe this page shows in the main page and styled the scrollbar.

[[WebDev]] page has been cleaned up! A small change that makes the page tidier. I moved Site Plans and Stuff to Fix sections from the [[WebDevCommonplace|web dev commonplace]] to [[SiteUpdates|this site's dev log]]. and added some new stuff like a link to the source code, a template, and the CSS variables for my color scheme!

In the commonplace notebook you can still find web dev resources, links to site I like, and web rings/cliques.

Color scheme in light mode makes it easier to distinguish text with urls in list! That's one item off the accessibility issues checked off!

I added [[Out of Sight, Out of Mind|a new short story]]! I also created a commonplace for [[Nature-inspiredArt|nature inspired art]]! On other news, updated [[WebDevCommonplace]] with another cool site and a new cool resource blogging.

Refocusing my efforts in writing and making that available in [[Writing|here]]. New [[Now]] entry. [[Links]] page is now available. It has buttons leading to other sites and a single webring I managed to apply to.

## October 30th, 2024
Finished updating the whole website with the new layout. Checked off a bunch of items from my [[SitePlans#Site Plans|site plans]] such as a site updates log (you're here!), a site map (see footer), using a minimalist layout, introducing iframes, and an accessibility statement (see footer).

Two important items left for accessibility are*adding alt text to images*Â and seeing whether to*add an option to manually change to dark mode*.

Welp, I had some free time added alt text and tested the dark mode. I'll keep the latter in the background for now. I also updated the [[WebDevCommonplace|commonplace notebook]] with more sites and resources.

Next might be setting up a guestbook and a links page.

I finished what I consider the version 0 of this site two weeks ago. I took a week off probably due to burnout and shiny new thing syndrome.

Today I'm back and highly-motivated. My main objective was to made another version of the homepage in a more minimalist style. A secondary objective was to decide on color schemes for light mode and mode. Both objectives were accomplished. The site is very blue.

Next, I would like to add a button to switch between these modes but I should test without it myself and see whether it's really necessary.
