## Title: Spring 2024 GIS Portfolio/ Introduction to GIS

## Subtitle
~~Showcasing my best work from GIS 3006 â€“ Mapping & Geovisualization.~~

## Course Description
This course introduced Geographic Information Systems as a tool to solve geospatial issues. Through weekly assignments we learned how to use ArcGISPro, ArcGIS Online, and ArcMaps for mapping purposes. Principles of cartography were heavily emphasized. 
> [!IMPORTANT] Use one map per example!
This included finding 
**quality data sources**, (Ex.7, "Request #2": https://usflibrary.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8df8253acef84698b1066f737095be59)
**querying data**, ( "Sharing Maps and Layers with ArcGIS Pro" ESRI Course (Ex. 7): "VolcanoData" https://usflibrary.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=574a84236cae419b8d9e098babeffa62)
**best practices for symbology**, (Ex.8 Part 2: Choropleth & dot density map layout)
**essential map elements**, ( Tampa Bay Seagrass cover (Midterm)) and
**sharing maps** ("Sharing Maps and Layers with ArcGIS Pro" ESRI Course (Ex. 7): "Risk_Data;")

## Main Takeaways
- ~~GIS is a growing discipline and the skills are becoming the norm in certain positions.~~
- ~~Most commonly, GIS is used in the sciences for mapping, monitoring, and data analysis.~~
- ~~Geographic Information Technology (GIT) is becoming more accessible to the general public as mobile maps, and computer and web software.~~
1. All maps must provide a citation of the original data displayed in it ~~the map~~. ~~basis of all research reading, using, and crediting reputable sources. ~~
2. Only present data relevant to the question.
3. Emphasize data features ~~of the data~~ relevant to the question and deemphasize the rest.
4. All maps must have a North arrow, a legend, and a scale.
5. Design maps with an audience in mind.

## 1. Finding and Citing Reputable Data
> Ex.7, "Request #2": https://usflibrary.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8df8253acef84698b1066f737095be59

Anyone with an ESRI account can publish content, regardless of the quality of their product. Thus, it is important to know how to identify quality data. Two features to look for are the **metadata** (the more the better) and the **publisher's username** (ie. "GIS Librarian" and email addresses from FWRI and other government institutions).

Just like citing a paper, when using map data, proper attribution is required. Citations must include the n*ame of the publisher and the data*, the *published date*, the *type of data* (usually "Online GIS Data"), the *date the data was accessed*, and the *link to the source*.

Maps are carefully crafted to answer a question. After choosing source data, the next step is to pick the features related to the question. The attribute table displays all the information of the data. There are various ways of cleaning up the data from tools, definition queries, and subsets.

## 3. Symbology Best Practices
> Ex.8 Part 2: Choropleth & dot density map layout

Displaying data is perhaps the skills that takes the longest to master. From color schemes to classification methods, good symbology choices allows the audience to intuitively understand and use a map.

## 4. Essential Map Elements
>  Tampa Bay Seagrass cover (Midterm) jpeg

Regardless of the type of map, all must include some visual elements to make them usable. The bare minimum are:

1. Legend
2. North Arrow
3. Scale Bar

Non-visual elements include a caption and a data citation. In this map, the visual element of an extent map is included to show the focus area at the state level.

~~Note: If it were for a printed journal, color symbology would have changed to shades of grey as they are printed in B/W.~~

## 5. Sharing Maps
> "Sharing Maps and Layers with ArcGIS Pro" ESRI Course (Ex. 7): "Risk_Data;" Use screenshots

The last step in the cartography process is to make the map available to the audience. Before GIS, the standard format was static maps. Now, geographic information can be shared through the web as webmaps, storymaps, map packages, etc. Choosing a map type depends on predicting or assuming the type of hardware and software the audience will possess to access the map.


This view is part of a map package of tsunami, volcano, and earthquake data in Japan.
