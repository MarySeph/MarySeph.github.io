# Site Manifesto

This site was created after a previous attempt using TiddlyWiki. With some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and some research on static website hosting platforms, staring October 2024 this site is being hosted on Neocities.

This webmaster comes from the personal knowledge management (PKM) boom from 2019. Apart from discourse on tool like Evernote, Notion, Roam, etc, there was also a sizable number of developers creating new PKM tools that prioritized privacy, independence, and content ownership. Somewhere in this discuss the concept of mind gardens grew and blossomed. Contrary to personal websites, I find that mind gardens are perhaps more "academic" or "philosophical" but no less important of course. Mind garden are places to grow and develop ideas. They may reach a robust truck of several meters high, a well-researched essay or a solid list of movie reviews with both the classics and obscure films. This is one of my backgrounds, and something that will become more important in my journey as a web developer as I acquire more experience.

The second and more personal reason of why I'm here may not be as specific as PKM. Simply put, as a creative person and human being who sought human connections, I have put myself out there in the internet. From fanfiction to graphic design, I have tried Wattpad, Tumblr, Ko-fi, Instagram, Gumroad, and have accounts in places I have barely touched. I didn't make a single cent off any off those sites, ever. Except for Wattpad, I didn't quite enjoy my time in the sites where my goal was to make a career off my art. Not all the fault is on the platform, I don't have a knack for marketing myself. there are write';rs and creators who have much more experience and can delve deeper off the struggles of creating a fanbase yada yada yada. Apart from being a valuable life experience, I learned from all of those social media platforms that keeping control of my own intellectual property was very important for me. In other words, I realized that by hopping from platform to platform, I was practically starting from zero in an environment that was foreign to me. I also realized that I enjoy writing longform content. It's why blogging in Tumblr and posting stories in Wattpad was one of my best times on social media. Sure, it was also lonely as hell but the once in a blue moon positive comment kept me going and finding people as passionate as I was about *the thing* was amazing. The algorithm in those sites may be against those who are into niche content but perusing through that niche was like finding a treasure chest full of riches. It was so personal and genuine and helpful.

Back to PKM, I was an avid follower of [Linking Your Thinking](). One of the things that spoke to me the most was how by building a personal web of knowledge and making it available to others (through the many options available at the times like public Notion sites, Obsidian Publish, or *hand-coded websites*) people could take back the promise of technology that was prevalent around the 2000s. I was born during that time. My parents saw human land on the moon, my brother and I were raised on Star Trek. We *love* tech; my dad is a handyman around the house, building small systems, installing things here and there. I grew up around that, and I have rekindled my passion for creation (and Star Trek). Technology promised us access to information, improved human connections, *the future.* But it didn't deliver. With a computer, I could learn a second language and practice things that I otherwise wouldn't have learned at school. Heck, I LEARNED how classify residues with Microsoft Encarta and there STILL isn't a reliable recycling system in my country. A passionate example too many, my personal narrative is that I grew in that in-between time where the internet was unregulated and witnessed its growing centralization, the birth of all major social media platforms today. ...I couldn't get behind the change. I liked knowing the memes all my classmates used, it made me feel part of the group, but I struggled to use social media consistently. To me, the screen was the window to a world of boundless knowledge and education and fun little browser games or MMOs to play with friends that required a damn good antivirus software. Needless to say, I felt left behind. 

Memories of teenage angst aside, the PKM community reignited by passion for technology and single-handedly revived my dying ideals. I got back into front-end on July 2022 after I finished my Associates and was taking another year off college to figure out my next step. My last experience with HTML and CSS was in middleschool and I neither never quite grew out of it nor develop it till then. Maybe I should post that whole journey. The experience is documented and the work products are online. I look back on it fondly. It was a free 30-day Skillshare subscription where I went through some web dev courses to refresh and grow my knowledge of front-end (HTML, CSS, and JS).

Fast forward to early 2024, after a lot of deliberation, I joined Cohost because of its focus on long-form content and we shared similar ideas about what a socially-responsible social media platform should be. I was getting into the platform over the summer, logging my progress as I designed a website using [TiddlyWiki](). I let it sit for a while and as answering a call, checked the site on September 31st--the day before the official shutdown. That's when I learned of website hosting alternatives Neocities and NekoWeb.

This manifesto is both a promise to you, dear web surfer, and me, the webmaster.

1. Accessibility

With this site, I want to practice the highest web accessibility standards for personal websites. [These guidelines I will follow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). I communicate potential and known accessibility issues [[Meta#Stuff to Fix|here]].

Let it be known that when I'm developing this site, I'm keeping low-vision readers, those with motion sensitivity, and mobile users in mind. Because of personal experience and aesthetic choices, I will refrain, at ANY point, from using blinkies, low-contrast images, and excessive gifs. However, if I do and I catch it, it will be noted in the above webpage.

I care about accessibility because I believe information should be free.

2. Multimedia

While this may seem like a text-heavy site, I do want to add other forms of media like images and videos while following best practices. Decorative graphics will be gentle and unobtrusive to the eye. Videos and images will be responsive and mobile-friendly.

One of the greatest strengths of digital media is its variety.

3. Creative
This personal website is part of a larger effort to learn and practice web accessibility, front-end web dev, and efficient communication. With the skills I am developing here, I want to create a professional portfolio, a mind garden, and a professional website (not in that order).
