# Thinking Critically about the Hedonist Theory of Well-being

Philosophical discourse on well-being stems from the question of what is 'good for' a person. In this paper, I will present the Hedonist theory of well-being, pose an objection, and reply to that objection.

The Hedonist Theory of well-being centers around the sensations of pleasure and pain, claiming that what's good for a person is seeking balance of both sensations across their life (Crisp, pg. 1). Under this theory, the sensation of pleasure is a measure of well-being, and the sensation of pain is a measure of ill-being. Thus, what _feels good_ (pleasure) _is good for_ a person.

Despite its apparent intuitiveness, this theory has been the subject of harsh criticism since its inception. Early objections rejected pleasure as a measure of, well anything, because it belonged to beasts, and humans were above pleasure as a path towards ultimate happiness. The following objection aims to reveal the complexity of this seemly accessible theory.

One well-known objection against the Hedonist Theory is the “Paradox of Hedonism” coined by Henry Sidgwick. It states that the pursuit of pleasure is always fruitless because pleasure is always the result of getting something else. In other words, pleasure is never a direct result but an indirect one. It is elusive. So, how can pleasure be what's good for a person if they can never obtain it?

The Paradox of Hedonism reveals that pleasure is an indirect result of unrelated events, however, pleasure is not the only element in the hedonist theory. If the paradox is correct, it has no bearing on the intent behind the hedonist theory to balance pleasure and pain. At most, it shows that pleasure is impossible to obtain intentionally, but that is just a single lane that has been closed, not the whole road. To put it simply, the methods behind the quest for pleasure and their respective success are unrelated to efforts to balance pleasure and pain. For example, a professional biker falls over and scrapes their leg. The wound burns. The next logical step would be to apply first aid to the wound as soon as possible. However, even if the wound was nursed, it may still hurt. In hedonist terms, the biker took measures to reduce pain through applying first aid. While pleasure was neither sought nor obtained, pain was diminished but not wholly removed. Thus, while pleasure was neither a direct nor indirect result, the effort to control the pain is _good for_ that person.

It seems that the Paradox of Hedonism may be useful to advance discussions on the nature of pleasure as a measure of well-being. Devising different methods that result in pleasure and/or the reduction of pain is outside the scope of philosophy. However, hedonist theorists may benefit from further considering why pleasure is most successfully obtained through indirect means.
