## On the Visits to Memorials

Our first visit to a memorial of murdered Jews during the Nazi regime was Auschwitz-Birkenau. The morning droplets promised a dreary day, fitting for the upcoming activity. The early schedule formed me swallow down my breakfast and swiftly pack that day's lunch. It was about the third day and I was already exhausted. Before this trip, I had the privilege of being able to take the day off when my body felt heavy. For that day, there was no such thing. Thus, I filed into the bus that would take us to the former camps and witness their bloody history.

I also had the misfortune of having only shorts available for that day. The long pair already worn down previously. Being sensitive to the cold, as the group was made to wait in line, I did my best to evade the harsh weather. Despite my discomfort, I didn't complain. It felt part of the ritual. Something that must happen. I chose to bear with it to honor the victims. Their suffering was much greater after all.

Many of my peers later commented the tour was rushed, Despite the awful weather, there were many people, just like us, making the rounds with a tour guide. Like sardines, we were shuffled from building to building, evading puddles and trying to not fall behind. My experience was vastly different. I had brought waterproof boots for uneven terrain and walked at my own pace for as along as I didn't keep the group out of sight.

The atmosphere was solemn and chaotic. Due to the heavy rain, most sounds were drowned out, giving the impression of dissociation from the tangible world. At that time, I wouldn't say I had formed connections with those in the group, so I guess I did feel isolated, although I wasn't uncomfortable about it.

Of Auschwitz, I took a single picture.

I saw this tree at the beginning of the tour, a new sprout extending it arm out. When I considered the possibility of this tree having witnessed the horrifying events that transpired in this place, I bawled. There might be a witness right in front of me and despite what they may or may not have seen, they were growing. This picture represents resilience in the face of unjustifiable suffering.

In may ways, Birkenau was the stark contrast to Auschwitz. Quiet and expansive, the ruins of the unspeakable horrors leave too much room for the imagination. On top of each foundation an overcrowded barrack with soon-to-be gassed people were locked up. Infectious disease were on a rampage and violence was the norm. Much like The Zone of Interest, what can't be seen is more terrifying than what can.

The sense of trepidation I felt is illustrated in the following picture, showing one of the inner gates of the camp. The angle shows an unnervingly long path delineated by barbed wired. It promises no comforts nor joyful times.

## On the Non-Jewish Victims

One of the most relevant historical findings I have taken out of this trip is the non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust. For the past 200 years, Poland has struggled to defend its sovereignty, twice from Russia. Their beef goes back centuries, and the Russian forces have occupied Poland twice during that time. The first was around the 19th century when their king was exiled, and the second was after the end of World War II. The Soviets were not merciful rulers and terrorized the population. The scars on the Polish people run deep. The way our guide spoke of the Soviet rule, her words dripped venom. She lived through those times, lucky enough to have witnessed the shift back to democracy.

Nationality or race wasn't the only motivation for persecution. Lesser known victims of the Nazi included but weren't limited to the Roma, gay men, disabled people, and prostitutes. They used the excuse of being "unproductive members of society" or "a burden on society" to imprison and execute them.

I believe that these lesser known victim groups, like our guide from Sachenhausen labor camp said, "reflected the values of the time." These people were persecuted because of the narratives of the times. Many, if not all of these prejudices, still persist.

The non-Jewish of the Nazi regime thus present a chilling possibility, that of intergenerational persecution of innocent groups of people. The remembrance of the Holocaust also brings forward questions of accountability. If no government recognizes the status of victimhood, then there's no need to make reparations because the illness is still there.

I believe the Holocaust was a matter of degree. Degree of violence, of persecution, of financial and material funding, of exploitation, etc. The Holocaust is terrifying because of its scale. A whole country gone mad with feverish fanatism and hatred whose crimes cannot be explained with a solid narrative. After peeling away the awe, reasonable conclusions can be drawn unrelated to degree. Acts of persecution, whether state-sponsored or not, are irrelevant to the gravity of the immoral act. No one deserved to go through any of the camps, no exceptions. By removing the labels imposed by the Nazis to justify their undesirability, all victims become human. They were human all along. 

## Expansionism and Environmental Ethics

I found that the places we visit there was a lack of conversation about the topic of environmental ethics. An an Environmental Science major with an interest in Philosophy, I was curious to test the hypothesis that along with the exploitation people, environmental exploitation would have happened hand in hand. Alas, there was little talk about the environment. Even so, I firmly believe that abusing people is the same as abusing the natural world because human beings (culture) are one with the environment. Furthermore, learning about the holes in the narrative about the Holocaust, the unacknowledged victims from all countries, leads to further theorize that the environment has been victimized but such an idea hasn't permeated the larger narrative about the Holocaust.

I believe that through investigating the kind of work the prisoners did, and tracing the place of the source material, there could be evidence of environmental exploitation. After all, slave laborers built tracks, roads, and houses. Where did they get those materials from? One of the guides said the prisoners worked for the big European brands, if so, is it no different from what's occurring now in countries with lax environmental regulations? For example, illegal deforestation is a huge issue in the Amazon rainforest. This land is used for cultivating the food for cattle to obtain beef and ship to international markets. Could something similar have happened back then?

Linking expansionism and a disregard for environmental ethics is simple enough. War is akin to destruction. Neither people nor the land nor water go through it unscathed. As I mentioned at the beginning, the state of the environment before, during, and after the Holocaust (perhaps all the camps to be specific), was never mentioned. How was the environment treated in these areas? What was the ecological diversity? How many trees were cut down and animals displaced to expand Auschwitz and Birkeneau? As I went through the camps and memorials, I imagined the time of their initial construction? Was it worth the damage to continue manipulating these places for the sake of remembrance?  Expanding the parking lot, making a new entrance for visitors, so on an so forth. This questioning brings me to the next topic.

## On Guilt and Responsibility

How much remembering is enough? How much does the perpetrator has to suffer to be enough for the victims? I don't believe in retributive justice, so I think an eye for a eye will leave everyone blind. Multiple times, I put myself in the shoes of the Germans. World War II and the Holocaust ended eighty years ago, for how long does guilt has to be instilled in the heart of all their people? While the ideals of Nazi Germany are still alive which is a great threat, there is a difference between reformation and punishment. Are the German people still being punished for their acts during the war and the Holocaust? I can't form an opinion about it in relation to the present. However, I do think the separation of East and West Germany was. The geopolitical landscape after World War II and I don't sit well with me. The Treaty of Versailles was unfair towards Germany, as far as I know, and the division of the country after the second war disgusts me. Neither result brought peace. It built up resentment, fear, and hatred. Right after the second war, another one sprung (the Cold War) between the powers that were still standing. The other countries were pawns in their game. Violence as a answer for violence solves nothing. When the enemy dies, the challenge isn't over. The victor will look for another opponent, and the cycle goes on.

Back to the topic at hand, the number of memorials around Berlin got me thinking. How many of them is enough? A rhetorical question. I don't think it's a question about quantity but a question about responsibility. How far does the German government has to go to take responsibility for the Holocaust? The ones outlined in the itinerary (museums and memories) are the most eye-catching. What about the tiles in Warsaw delineating the borders of the Jewish ghetto, or the square tiles in front of the houses that were once inhabited by Jewish people before relocation? 

Berlin left the strongest impression. The day before the last day of the trip, part of the group was on its way to get lunch. We got off the station and were making our way to the location. Right outside, there was a statue of seven forms, five on one side, two on the other. They seemed to be children. Upon further inspection, I found a place that said "Trains to Life / Trains to Death." The five forms were Jewish children, expressions uncertain and bags empty. On the other side, two German children on their way to school.

I was struck. My body was tired. I wanted, needed food. I was so disturbed by the statue that I took a picture and told one of my companions, "I'll process that later." I can only imagine the experience of growing up in a city where in any moment one could be struck by art that evokes churning feelings of real, historical events. At that moment, I could emphasize with the reaction of wanting to look away. I did nothing wrong. I was just following the group to get something to eat and go my own way. These feelings were no different from the man I saw as I walked back to that station after lunch. His mouth was agape and he looked over the statue from different sides. He bore an appearance of shock and disbelief. 

The pieces of art for remembrance made me consider how much is too much? Where's the point between taking responsibility and guilty as a form of self-harm? Many of my peers were shocked to hear that the summer camp near Sachenhausen was aimed towards children. That they swam in the lake where ashes of those murdered in the camp were scattered. I believe that placing boundaries is necessary to protect the mind. In other words, escapism is a form of coping in situations where one feels helpless. On the other hand, one person from the group with a Jewish background couldn't comprehend why these places with a history violence hadn't been shut down at any point after the Holocaust. From a humanitarian perspective, her reasoning is sound. However, if blocking off places of violence was the norm, then which place on Earth could people settle? Human progress relies on human and non-human sacrifice. I doubt there is a place on Earth where human blood hasn't been spilled. I believe the current situation in those places have more nuance than what the tour guide could share. It is our responsibility to continue our education, ask questions, and stand up against injustice.

## The Politics of Remembrance

At last but not least, I want to focus on some of the factors that influence the museums and memorials from this trip, politics, finance, and logistics. I believe that maintaining the sites costs a large amount of money and kicking off a new project as well. Thus, I am intrigued by the political battle behind the scenes of sites such as Auschwitz and the House of the Wansee Conference. Were do they get their funding? How does the marketing team reach out to current and potential investors? Who decides where the money goes? It is easy to forget that behind the sites we visited, there were a lot of people who worked very hard to make them happen.

Among my peers, Auschwitz left a strong impression of a tourist site. We had to wait for our tickets before getting in line which also took a while. Guided tours were the only option and he moved from rooms and barracks at a speed that they found hindered their experience. There was no time to stay and experience, letting the information sink it. Many groups were behind us waiting for their turn. We could not lag behind. Thus, given the popularity of sites like this, ethical questions such as the "proper attitude" to visit a memorial site spring up. These groups were from all over the world. Personally, my grandmother had the intention to go on a tour from the local Catholic Church in Ecuador (South America) which included many concentration camps including Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka. My peers thus described the experience as "going to Disney." The similarity between an amusement park and a memorial have high visitor rates. How are these places marketed towards people? What makes them so popular? I was definitely among that group, regardless of the purpose of the trip, I was just another tourist traversing blood-stained soil.

As conversation about the reduction of living Holocaust survivors built, my thoughts were on a distance future were the Holocaust became a mundane part of human history. Funding for restoration and maintenance would dwindle as public interest lessened. Vine would grown around the preserved buildings, and no plaque about the event would be legible in all of Europe. Did humanity forgot about the Holocaust because they were living in peace? Or because it was systematically erased by those wanted to repeat the past?

There is much to discuss about remembrance and human memory. Perhaps Germany and Poland's effort to remember the Holocaust isn't to discomfort those living inside its borders but a challenge to those in the distance future to erase what we know as fact today.
