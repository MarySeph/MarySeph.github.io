# Crochet Bath Set Collection

This is another collection of various crochet projects. I made made these items multiple times for various people and I find great joy in making them. There's something so lovely in making handcrafted presents focused on self-care. Even if no one in my family has been particularly grateful for these presents, I will keep making them and giving them away!

### Notes:
An emergency project I had to whip up from scratch. I had to evacuate from my dorm in a day for the second time and I decided to rely on the next project on this list instead of packing a towel (which wasn't a gamble I promise). Fortunately, I was at home so I could calmly assess that the crochet towel I was using wasn't big enough to dry my hair. So I did what I always do, be creative about it.

The videos I looked up weren't much help, so at the end this patter is pretty original. The only inspiration I took was the halfmoon stitch which has become one of my favorite for anything kitchen and bath related.

It took a lot of trial and error and one impulse purchase, and I ended up with this style of headband for after a bath/shower. I decided to make another one as a [[2024XmasPresents#Headband|Christmas present for my grandma]] adjusting for head size. I haven't asked her for feedback, so I don't know what to improve yet.

The following is a rough pattern. Like all head garments, always adjust for size. Also, disclaimer, I made this pattern for my hair type which is mostly straight. I have no idea how useful or potentially harmful this pattern might be for other hair types. Do what's best for you.

BODY
1. Base chain: Make a chain that loosely wraps around the head. I suggest to err in the smaller length because this headband is bound to stretch.
2. R1: (<a href="https://youtu.be/NfBqSohnY48?si=BFuIk3SvuZmJ2yFn">half-moon stitch</a>)  Sc in 2nd ch from the hook, sk 1 ch, 3 sc, sk 3 ch, repeat until last two chains, sk 1 ch, sc, ch 1, turn.
3. Sc, sk 2 st, 3 sc (middle stitch from 3sc in prev. row), 
4. Build height until it covers just above the head.

ELASTIC BAND
- We will need to cut two strands of elastic. I used an elastic band bc its what they had at the craft store. You can get creative and use what you have like elastic thread. The elastic band *will* be visible so if you decide to go this route too, perhaps buy a muted or contrasting color. Go wild! 
- The first band strand will be used to gather the top of the headband, while the second will gather the lower part. Regardless of the order, one strand needs to be longer than the other. Loosely measure the top of your head as if it were a crown with the elastic band and cut. Then measure from the top of your eyebrows around the underside of your hair, passing your ears and cut. Hope that made sense.
- Do your best to keep an eye out for which is which. I placed them parallel to each other mirroring their intended position.


## Wash Towel
<small>Pattern: <a href="https://youtu.be/bWc-_nv1XPw?si=pSwCd5P4nVTeA2Y1">Dotty Dishcloth by TheTurtleTrunk</a></small>

### Materials
- Hook: 4.5mm
- Scissors
- Stitch marker

#### Yarn
- A: Allegro, Tango, color Crudo.
- B: Allegro, Tango, color Cafe.

### Notes:
An unexpected entry in this collection. I made a pair exchanging the colors for the body and border. The other currently serves as a dishcloth and this one ended up as a washcloth. The thick and absorbent cotton yarn makes it useful as a replacement for a full towel, if just slightly too small for me. I would recommend increasing the initial chain count. Very useful for travel.
