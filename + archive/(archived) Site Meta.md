This site is being developed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)-flavored markdown then converted to HTML in VSCode before being uploaded to Neocities.

The site's [source code](https://github.com/MarySeph/Marys-Creative-Corner) and a [page template](https://github.com/MarySeph/Marys-Creative-Corner/blob/main/template.htm) are available on Github for download.

Copyright statement of this site is pending.

Read the annoyingly long, overly-dramatic and totally unfinished [[Site Manifesto|manifesto]].

## Accessibility
This website has been designed to be responsible on mobile and desktop. See below for potential accessibility issues.

There are some iframes that I'm not sure if they pose an issue. A search didn't give me an answer on that.

**Disclaimer:** I don't use a screen reader or any other type of assistive device to surf the web. If there's any section of this website that is inaccessible, [please drop me a message](https://maryseph.atabook.org/). I'm an indie web dev who's learning about web accessibility and would appreciate the feedback.
