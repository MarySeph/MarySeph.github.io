    <p>Or, how this site was made.</p>

    <h2 id="principles">Key Principles</h2>
        <p>This website was created, handcoded, and tested for accessibility by yours truly. This is a personal, text-first, static, website that uses minimal JavaScript, images, and styling. As an advocate of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> movement, this website is free of tracking services and corporate marketing. The webmaster is the sole owner of the website and its content. They are committed to the accessibility of this website, taking great care to adhere to it principles and improve the accessibility of new content and versions of this site.
        </p>

    <h2 id="tech">Technologies & Techniques</h2>
        <p>This site was drafted in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, turned into HTML/CSS, in VSCode, tested for accessibility on Chrome and Firefox Desktop, and on Ecosia for mobile, and hosted in Neocities, all using a refurbished HP Elitebook.
        </p>
        <p>I use git to track changes—both in Obsidian and VSCode—and upload it to a private Github repo. For web development, I apply the <a href="https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/">git-flow</a> workflow system. Keeping it short, I have three active branches, main (branch that gets sent to Neocities), develop (for quick changes and base branch for final branch type), and feature-NAME (can be one or multiple). The last focuses on testing specific additions to the website like content, layouts, or color schemes.
        </p>
        <p>To transfer the content from Obsidian to HTML, I literally copy-paste the content from the Github. This is why I have found it useful to apply git-flow. feature-NAME has been a lifesaver because I can see all the edits and/or new content I need to add in one place. I use handcoded templates in HTML and Markdown to speed up the setup process to create new pages, make more templates as needed.</p>
    
    <h2 id="wri-and-ed">Writing and Editing</h2>
        <p>Most of the content is written in Obsidian. All pages start as Markdown files. This helps me focus on just getting the words down as I can get lost in the fine details in web development. I must note however that minimal HTML can show up depending on the creative process, usually bits of code that will be sent to VSCode to be usable.
        </p>
        <p>Folder structure is also tested in Obsidian as I've found it's a real pain to fix broken links on the HTML stage. Editing might occur in VSCode if I notice grammatical errors or something else I feel like adding.</p>

    <h2 id="history">Site History</h2>
        <p>It's tentative launch date is 2025 Pride Month. The vision for this site is a hub for all my past and future original and fandom related-writing.</p>
