# Social Media Presence Cleanup

What the heck is this? How did I get here? At one point, I was downloading the data from my X/Twitter account and the next I was assessing a bunch of accounts and deleting those that served no purpose whatsoever. No time for the winter blues when the urge to minimize social media hits. Or it can be the 3pm coffee. It's *definitely* the 3pm coffee.

Now, I'm looking over the accounts that I *do* want to keep in my life, and I have lot of plans for a new website. Basically for the secret identity that I want to keep secret. I have been playing with these two identities for almost a decade. This is new step is but another. The boundaries are always blurry but this time the effort feels more intentional.

The most important step, and the first really, is the effect on this site. As you may now, I am hosting this site on Neocities and have a working backup in Github. The latter comes with an intial repo for the user's main project. Mine is maryseph.github.io. I want to move this website to that repo, with a few changes. I will remove the Writing section and rename this site to simply my username, MarySeph. 

I have big plans (more like dreams) for a new writing hub. I have been playing around with digital gardens and it's time to host it in my own website now! I want to want to add a blog. The contents of these two writing efforts will most likely focus on science, bullet journaling, mental health, green living and whatever other topic I deem appropriate. I have always intended this site to become a more, professional site without the intense branding. I will keep the Crafts and Web Dev sections and introduce what I have learned through the PKM community along the years. I will practice POSSE (Post On Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) through Wordpress. 

I also have a Gumroad account that I'm not sure what to do with. Currently, I'm offering some Notion templates and college class notes as pdf files. Let me know if you have any suggestions. You can make an argument to convince me to close the account too and propose an alternative. I'm open to suggestions.

Sooo, here's the checklist:

- [ ] Transfer Mary's Creative Corner (repo) to MarySeph.github.io.
- [ ] Rename Mary's Creative Corner to MarySeph

Wait, now that I think about it... where am I going to host the other site. Problem for future me. I'm obviously going to host that site on GithubPages. Hm, maybe my neocities site WILL be the new site. New me! I'm going to miss you guys! Wait but if I make that site's source code public people will be able to find both sites... AHHHHHH!!!! I guess, I can't do that... Well, we'll see. Please send any suggestions my way! I'm so stumped...

Moving on, here's the [Wordpress blog](https://maryswritinggarden.wordpress.com/) I will be using. It dates back to I think 2021. The little is there will give you a look at what's to come. I will be adding an RSS at some point to both(?). I need to do some research. It's current being hosted on Wordpress but I want to set it up in my laptop. I also want to... you know, give it an actual personality.

Oh wowzies, let me interrupt myself for a sec. I forgot I had a Medium account were I was crossposting. I'll *probably* delete that account. Yup! I feel like focusing on my site and one external one seems manageable enough. Plus, I have another site with their own external sites. Yeah, that's enough in my plate.

One last thing, one side-project that will come out of this is a one-page with links to the aforementioned. Actually, do I need that? Counting now, I will have this site, a Wordpress blog, maybe a Gumroad account, and Github. There might be a BlueSky account on the far horizon too. Hmmm, I'll think about it. I already found some templates to start with. That will be, four of five accounts? At *least* three (website, Wordpress, and Github) I could probably host that one-page site on a Github repo. Seems very lightweight.

Just to keep it front of mine. These are the websites I'm going to be using:
- [This site](https://maryseph.neocities.org/)
- [Wordpress](https://maryswritinggarden.wordpress.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/MarySeph)

Optional:
- ~~Gumroad~~ (decided to delete it after all)
- ~~BlueSky~~ (pending; don't count on it)

Fortunately, a Github account doesn't require much upkeeping because it's part of my workflow. So technically, I will be focusing most of my efforts in the first two accounts.

A BlueSky account sounds nice in *theory* but I like to ramble (as you can see). That means I run opposite to short form content. I *am* eyeing [status.cafe](https://status.cafe/) though. Seems pretty chill, what with not being able to interact with users, haha. No idea what that says about me.
