## Notes:
So, if you have read about [[Hexagon Shirt - Take 1|this fiasco]] you may be wondering, "Mary, what are you going to do with the yarn?" Well, thanks for asking! That's what this project was for!

So, they day before I returned to my parents' house, they bought a dresser for my mom. It looked pretty plain so I found a pattern to make a simple table runner for it! This pattern was such a yarn eater, I probably used one whole ball! It was just what I wanted. I even added the tassels! Such an elegant pattern. I would make more if tables didn't get dirty in this house. The pattern wasn't really hard in any way after I got the grasp on it. Which was after frogging to add the depressions to make a zig zag instead of a V-shape, HAHA! It was nice to learn something new. Gosh, I love staring at it! It took me a few days to choose to add the tassels, otherwise, I would say this took me about a few hours without counting messing up the pattern and reducing the length (more frogging yes).
