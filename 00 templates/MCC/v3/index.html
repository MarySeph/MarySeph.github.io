        <h1>welcome to my site!</h1>
        <p>Hullo! My name is Mary!</p>
        <p>This is my first neocities site. I want to make this a space to share my creative hobbies like crochet, creative writing, and web development.</p>
        <p>I decided to join neocities after cohost (an independent social media platform) shut down. I have been working on a personal website and while I didn't use cohost as must as I wanted to, I yielded to the largest number of users who reccomended Neocities and I'm starting the project from scratch with a less professional style (maybe).</p>
        <p>I'm inspired by the creativity, personal narratives, and passions of the indie web. I recently finished watching <strong>Jellyfish Can't Swim in the Night</strong> and was attracted to the idea of <u>online identities as a form for self-expression independent of online marketability</u>.</p>
        <h2>Current Plans</h2>
        <p>I'll probably continue and expand my work from cohost so look forward to the following pages:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>dev log: all about front-end web development</li>
        <li>writings: creative writing stuff</li>
        <li>crafts: C R O C H E T, and other supporting crafts like sewing.</li>
        </ul>
