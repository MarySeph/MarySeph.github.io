        <h1>A Short Story About Tadashi and Dashi</h1>
            <p><i>Hikage Tadastsugu; 8 years old.</i><br>
            Dashi; 1 year (18 human years)</p>
            <p>This section opens with an introduction of the characters and themes.</p>
            <p>Dashi, a young goldfish bred for commercial purposes, is given as a prize for a little boy in a Japanese festival.
                Despite failing to retain her freedom, she doesn't lose hope. Her mindset is that of survival and she tends to act
                before thinking. If there had been an opportunity to escape, she would have taken it, consequences be damned.</p>
            <p>Night falls and the next day arrives. Dashi is brought to Tadashi's room and placed in the tank. She struggles to
                comprehend her new environment. As people come up to her and she instinctively hides behind some of the props, she
                realizes they were put there intentionally. As the boy who sleeps and wakes up in the same room talks to her day
                after
                day, dropping things into her domain and feeding her at around the same times everyday, her attitude begins to
                change.
                As there is no competition over food and her space is large, her begins to see the boy in another light.</p>
            <p>For the first time in her life, Dashi finds herself thinking. First, there is a sense of panic from losing something.
                Now that she doesn't have to fight to live, she ends up asking herself, "what is the point of living?" She thought
                that
                doing everything possible to get enough food to keep her alive was enough but her current lifestyle seems to make
                her
                question this belief.</p>
            <p>Then, as she come to spend more time with the boy, listening to him, playing together (with the things in the tank),
                she
                begins to find possible answers. One of the things that influenced her the most was looking at the various picture
                books
                that the boy showed her. Even if she didn't understand a word of what was written in the book or the boy said, she
                found
                herself growing curious and immersed in the boy's world.</p>

            **TL;DR: This segment focuses on Dashi's initial attitude towards life. A self-centered attitude towards one's
            well-being.**
            
            > Hikage Tadashi; 15 years old.
            > Dashi; 8 years (74 human years)
            
            Seven years have passed since Dashi arrived in Tadatsugu's. Since then, the little boy has grown and goes by Tadashi. A
            middle school third year, he's preparing for high school entrance exams. The relationship he had with his parents is
            vastly different. In a way, Dashi and the aquarium was the last gift he received from them. Naturally, since they wanted
            their son to be reliable and curious about living beings, so he believes.
            
            Lately, his relationship with Dashi is minimal. Laying beside the bed, his eyes are drawn to the captivating landscape
            inside the tank. From rocks to algae and beautiful gravel, Dashi's aquarium is an spectacular sight. Staring at it
            comforts him. His first design when he was merely ten years old. The thing that caused so many things to go wrong.
            
            Back then, Tadashi had found a book about aquarium design. He had already read all the literature on goldfish care for
            his age and slightly above. He could name their bones by memory, and could recite their physical and psychological
            abilities. In other words, he knew goldfishes inside and out. To a curious young mind, there had to be more.
            
            All he wanted was to make a pretty home for his friend. He learned his lesson and didn't not drop things inside
            nilly-willy. He read to learn what could he put and not put in an aquarium.
            
            For some reason, his parents didn't understand. He tried to make their son see reason. "Feeding it is enough." "Focus in
            your studies." "If the science books aren't enough for you, I'll bring some from my office." That day, Tadashi learned
            the tough lesson that his parents supported his hobby because they wanted him to become a scientist. It's why his room
            was filled with books about fish and stars and animals and all sorts of *facts.* It's why they never bought him art
            supplies past his sixth birthday.
            
            Implementing the design was hard to keep secret. Even with his sister's help, the materials were pricey. The idea of
            disobeying his parents terrified him but after coming to school the following days and seeing Dashi's tank with a couple
            of fake plants and cheap gravel, he approached the tank and placed a hand on it.
            
            Dashi approached. This was their greeting.
            
            Tadashi stared at the goldfish. Then, he brought a chair and put his hand on the glass and leaned his forehead. He
            closed his eyes, reminiscing of his parents' strong rejection. When he opened them, Dashi was there, under his nose. The
            beautiful tint of gold against a deep blue backdrop and purple lightning would make Dashi shine like a goddess. He could
            see the finished product in his mind. His design was complete. The item list compiled. He wanted Dashi to have a
            beautiful home with plenty of plants to hide behind and structures to explore; rings to play with and places to sleep.
            
            Parents be damned. Dashi was worth it. She spent more time with him than his parents. She listened. She cared. She
            appreciated what he did for her.
            
            Tadashi woke up from a knocking sound. Through the door, the housekeep informed she was on her way out. Tadashi stood
            and wiped the traces of fogginess away. As he observed Dashi eat, he wondered if she did appreciate his efforts. Did he
            resent the goldfish? Or did he resent himself and was seeking comfort? Dashi's aquarium design was one of the many
            stored somewhere with Amano-sensei's *Nature Aquarium World*. The more he drew, the more pointless it seemed. At some
            point, he couldn't find it in himself to draw a [Ryoboku landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquascaping#Ryoboku)
            and his creative energy moved to fabrics.
            
            As if he was scared of facing a nightmare, he couldn't bring himself to face the aquarium and talk to Dashi, or himself
            with her as the audience, like he used to. He tells himself that the fact he's thinking these things is enough. Coming
            back to this room, he can look at the aquarium and tell himself he's satisfied. Turning back wouldn't fix his
            relationships with his parents, so this was enough.
            
            **TL;DR: This section focuses on Tadashi's growth, or negative growth(?). From being deeply engaged with Dashi's
            well-being and comfort, he's been keeping her at a distance. The flashback shows that in between scenes, Tadashi has a
            tense relationship with his parents because of his budding interest in the arts, more specifically, aquascaping
            (landscaping an aquarium), which his parents strongly rejected. Tadashi can't find the courage to face Dashi, and
            therefore himself, by facing the aquarium head on. He tries to convince himself that thinking he's satisfied and doing
            the bare minimum for Dashi is good enough.**
            
            > Hikage Tadashi; 24 years old.
            > Dashi; 16 years (138 human years)
            
            At some point, Tadashi had become a grown man. When no one was looking, he wore a self-satisfied smile and laughed to
            himself. Compared to how he had behaved in the past, against the bed as if life was full of miserable, this state of
            things was much preferable for Dashi.
            
            To her surprise and amazement, Tadashi approached the tank and set a chair in front of her. He lowered himself to her
            level and stared at her with a strained, shaky smile. As if he couldn't bear the silence any longer he began talking. He
            gestured wildly like he used to many many years ago. He was in a world of his own and Dashi was the sole spectator to
            this one-man show. The spectacle captivated her with nostalgia. Her boy was in a good mood. Feeling the age weight on
            her bones, she shook her fins as a cheer.
            
            Slowly and steadily, the room was emptied. From books to the telescope and finally the bed sheets, it was then time for
            Dashi, for the second time in her life, to leave her home. This time, she feared nothing. She had been watching over her
            boy for a great deal of her life. She did tricks when Tadashi was looking and stayed as close as possible when he was
            struggling. She learned there was only so much she could do, not being able to approach him until the edge of her tank,
            but that didn't mean she could do nothing.
            
            Her rash youth might have led her to jump out of the tank, consequences be damned. She had become wiser. No matter how
            frail, their connection was still there. There was hope to strengthen it. That mean she could reach him one day.
            
            Dashi was gently tossed back in the aquarium. The landscape was a little untidy but her favorite spots were untouched so
            she didn't mind. Shifting her focus to the world outside, she noticed the space wasn't Tadashi's room. This was much
            larger and with furniture she had never seen before.
            
            Living in his own, Tadashi chose to put Dashi's tank in the living room closest to the entrance. That way, he could
            greet Dashi before leaving and when coming back. Dashi patiently listened and supported him, and Tadashi spent more time
            talking with her. Although he didn't have to time to modify Dashi's and he was concerned for stressing her at her age,
            he put decorations outside the tank and a few time a year, added a piece of driftwood. His priority was to care for
            Dashi until her final days. Aquascaping was something he started because of self-interest. He couldn't tell if Dashi
            actually liked his design. He didn't want to buy things and cluttering her space. He hoped that time in each others'
            company is something both fishfolk and humans treasured.
            
            **TL;DR: Tadashi moved out of his family home, bringing Dashi with. With a new sense of freedom and reinvigorated, he
            strives to do right by Dashi's side. First, by placing her aquarium at the entrance, she can have a wider view than
            being confined in a bedroom. Aware that their time together is running short, Tadashi hopes that their exchanges are as
            meaningful to her as they have been to him.**
