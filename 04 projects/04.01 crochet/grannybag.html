    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>This is a bag that I have been working on and modifying for about a year. I don't have pictures of the previous version
    but it's pretty much the pattern I follow with the listed yarn.</p>
    <p>The base is made of a granny square which gives it some width.</p>
    <p>I had to modify the first version because the thin straps hurt my shoulders. I chose to get some thingies for extra
    strength. The first ones I used were untreated wood and one broke when thrown in the drier. This version is made with
    some cheap metal alloy.</p>
    <p>I increased the thickness of the straps and added a closure for them. I was imitating the design of my dad's string bag.</p>
    <p>The next set of modifications came about because the crochet shoulder straps were too long (dated June 2025). I spent
    way more than I intended because I had no idea what I wanted, from metal thingies to straps. In the end, I changed the
    bag from a drawstring type to a backpack style. I also changed the type of closure from two drawstrings to a flap and
    one drawstring.</p>
    <p>I bought two types of metal thingies, a set of two for the shoulder straps and another set of two to make them
    adjustable. Except these metal thingies are too small so adjusting the straps would be a huge pain. Fortunately, the
    straps are just the perfect size so I don't have to. I guess those metal things are working best to keep the strap size
    in place, haha.</p>
    <p>Cuz I had a bunch of leftover yarn, I was able to make the flap and the drawstring following the instructions. I had to
    buy a set of those wood things with hole to pass the strap around and close the bag. Man, so much leftover materials...</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, I frigging ADORE how the bag looks! The way the shoulder straps are sewn is just <i><b>chef's kiss</b></i>. The
    pattern from Kane Crochet was great. My new bag closes wonderfully. You would think it was made by a pro (not me).
