# On Being Human in a Wild World

These are the principles that bring value to my life. They are an effort to live in harmony with other-than-human neighbors.

1.  Transcendentalism

That which cannot be seen, nor measured is the realm of philosophy. It is the language of thought and intellect, and impossible to master. Transcendentalism as a intellectual movement lives on. It's core is vague but that's where its strength lies, keeping it relevant two-hundred years after its inception. For me, seeing what's beneath the surface means asking questions. About reality, about my role in the world, about my everyday life. Where do I come from, and where am I going? How can I make this a better place to live than when I arrived? These questions with no definitive answers have led be to different philosophies modified by people before my time. Transcendentalism to be, is the philosophy of change.

1.1 Simple Living 

I want to have a simple life. A simple life where I am surrounded by people I care about who care about me when I don't. A life where I contribute to the community. A life where I and those around me are healthy of body and mind. A creative life. A life that allows change.

A simple life is not easy to maintain. It requires mindfulness and resilience. It requires accepting change, and never losing sight of what makes life most fulfilling. There are several parts of my life that constantly fill with clutter. These are the principles I go by the keep myself in check.

1.1.1 Minimalism

An overall philosophy of Minimalism support a simple life. It is the practice of identifying clutter and taking responsibility for it. It is also the courage of letting go.

1.1.1.1 Digital Minimalism

A philosophy in the book by Cal Newport with the same name, it applies Thoreau's experiment at Walden Pond to technology. What are the perceived and actual benefits of current technologies we use everyday? Which can be let go? By being intentional of our use of technology, we take control of our time and attention and put them into things that align with our goals and values.

1.2 Civil Disobedience

Thoreau's brand of Transcendentalism encourages Civil Disobedience. Much like social reformers much closer to our time, it is a matter between authority, the individual, and ethics.

I practice civil disobedience by going against the flow. By being a thinker, a questioning force. But also by respecting my values and daring to be myself. As I can sense the commodifying force of the majority, I believe it is a courageous act to stand out. I consider social law to be more intimidating than legal law, for it is unwritten yet communicable. The will of the majority is but the will of strong. It is neither just nor right. To be a questioning force, one must dare to make others uncomfortable, if only ever so slightly. What's important is not the reaction of others but the act of voicing one's thoughts.

1.3 Higher Laws

That being said, what is right and what is wrong? What is this Higher Law which motivates Civil Disobedience? Some things are plain wrong. One can feel it at their core. Perhaps it is merely a survival instinct. Perhaps not. It is a topic that requires further thought.

2.  Resource Recovery & Management

I consider Resource Recovery and Management as the practice of recording the use and distribution of material and immaterial resources. It encourages the mindfulness of one's resources, their use, and the willingness to share them. It is the spirit behind garage sales, Spring Cleaning, and donating to local charities. It is a philosophy that bestows value upon objects that must be shared. It builds a sense of community and liberates mental and material baggage. It creates people who are mindful of their consumption and part ways with the objects that have outlived their stay to bring value and joy to another. It denies the concept of trash, seeing objects as a sum of its parts capable of taking another form. Material objects are seen as another form of living things in the natural world. A wooden cabin deserves the same respect as the uncut tree, a metal spoon is another form of the rock, the wool sweater holds the essence of water and the sheep. In other words, some objects are secondary form, a combination of different constituents of different degrees. The difference in shape does not diminish its value, only its purpose.

This philosophy is related to [[#Transcendentalism]] for its quality of looking beyond the surface.

2.1 Repair Economy

Because objects have intrinsic value, they are treated with care. In an ideal world, people have access to spare parts, or have the skills to repair or modify various objects used in a daily basis. Some of these basic skills are plumbing, electric, cooking, sewing, carpentry, and others. This would extend the life of an object.

When the object becomes unable to fulfill its purpose, it can be given new life with a new purpose. Old college shirts become rags, rotten logs become doorstoppers, cardboard boxes become castles. It becomes a matter of creativity and time.

The repair economy empowers the person, the family, and the community. It can create local jobs, and unite people through the act of sharing.

2.2 Gift Economy

In conjunction, the gift economy opens the doors to the object to return to The Cycle. From passing down toys from older to younger siblings, to helping the neighbors install tricky furniture, the Gift Economy is a constant act of sharing the material and immaterial. It assumes that the world is in an ever-process of change. People, their needs, and their wants. A clear example is the growth of children. First, parents need appropriate toys and tools. The child grows quickly, and with it, their appropriate care. Nevertheless, many children have similar basic needs: nourishment, comfort, enrichment, and care. Thus, the objects capable of providing this care can be gifted from one family to another, blood related or not. The object, through its use and the maintenance care given, is imbued with history. For history to be remembered, it must be passed down.

2.2.1 Knowledge and Wisdom

Just like material objects, knowledge and wisdom can also go through The Cycle. It is the tool-using behavior, the values, and the intergenerational history. In other words, it is the service of teaching. A most powerful tool, teaching enables people to pass down complex ideas, methods, and behaviors. It also alleviates the expectations of knowing. By acknowledging the limits of a person's understanding and experience, people can come together and share what they know. Its effects are unmeasurable.

Knowledge and wisdom can also take different forms. From improving methods to joining ideas together, the immaterial metamorphosizes. Immaterial objects, because they are formless, can be shared to a greater number of people in the same amount of time. This is one of the biggest assets of the internet.

The world of zeros and ones operates in a different metaphysical level from the material and knowledge. Software is a type object that is doesn't have a physical form but it has a shape. It does not retain the essence of the tree, the soil, nor the water. While it is in its own category, it is a resource. Through the internet or physical copies, and a computer, the tools, and the knowledge on how to use them can be made accessible. One such example is open-source software. The code is made available at no cost, and it can be modified without restrictions.

One step in between software and in-person teaching is blueprints. Patenting for profit limits access to knowledge, and if the blueprint remains static, the knowledge within it under key and lock, destined to fade away.

2.3 Subsistence Living

Take what you need and leave enough for the rest.

The importance for participating in The Cycle has been established. It gives value to objects and connects people across time and place. But what is this Cycle?

3.  Ecology

At last but not least, the most important concept. The beginning and the end. Thoreau's time at Walden has been a great inspiration which has brought me feelings of kindship. The principles of ecology support Transcendentalism and Resource Recovery & Management efforts, providing scientific support for these philosophies. It is no explanation for The Cycle.

3.1 Relations of Reciprocity

By subscribing to the belief that everything in this world affects each other to different degrees, then it makes sense that harm and healing goes in diverse ways. If by harming another living thing or myself I am causing harm to another living being, then I just might think twice about it. Likewise, there is motivation to take actions in favor of myself and other living beings. In the Western world, actions to reduce harm have taken many forms. From reducing red meat intake to preventing the exploitation of farm animals who produce massive amounts of methane, graze the land, and motivate deforestation; to permaculture, the movement to heal the world is stronger than ever. The environmental movement acknowledges that by exploiting natural resources faster than they can recover is not sustainable. While there are many opinions and ways inside this movement, many agree that the harm caused to nature eventually makes its way back to us.

My ideas on Relations of Reciprocity are less clinical. It is akin to friendship, feelings of care without considering the potential benefits. It is goodwill.

3.1.1 Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is one of the philosophies that I have been following before I had learned of it. It is a philosophy that stands for the greater good, reducing pain and discomfort for the greatest number of people. For humans, it included education for all, and for other-than-humans, their welfare, to mention an example. It is a philosophy based on hedonism; pleasure is Good, and pain is Bad. Nevertheless, such a simple concept has allowed many people and communities to live better lives in their respective time periods. The philosophy for the greater good is always transforming according to the needs of humanity. The greater good has expanded to include other-than-humans, assuming that what is good for them, is also good for us in ways we cannot even begin to comprehend.

3.1.2 Veil of Ignorance

On way to support the greater good of other-than-humans is to adapt Rawl's Veil of Ignorance. It is a political thought experiment that considers a pre-society state where thinkers try to strip themselves of their identities. The aim of this experiment is to brainstorm a society where they could be born as any gender, socio-economic status, or denomination that would affect their quality of life. The objective is to consider the social services of those with the least "luck" in life. For example, parents leave for everyone or sufficient minimum wages for subsistence living.

This attempt to empathize with those in unfortunate situations can be extended to other-than-humans. If we were migrating birds, would we want giant metal birds on our migration routes? If we were old trees, would we want to be removed from our home without our consent? I think that silly thoughts like this extend personhood to other-than-human species which might just change something in us.

3.2 Animacy

The extension of personhood to other-than-human others is an effort of animacy. Animacy assumes other-than-humans have their own way of life. Water is not a lake or a bay; it *becomes* one. It assumes intellect in other-than-humans, including objects. Such a worldview makes human existence much richer and entertaining, for we are then surrounded by cultures and languages that we can observe but cannot comprehend, much like seeing people of a different culture speaking another language. It makes us face the limitations of our understanding and puts us in our place as part of this wonderful world, not their master.

3.3 Cycle of Life & Death

Finally, one important idea that I have alluded to is the cycle of life and death. This is the cycle of transformation, not of finite. Life and death are not at odds. Death is not the end of all things, but the start of another life. By thinking of existence as inside a cycle where everything in it is capable of changing shape, then we must treasure the temporal form of everything around us. Each meeting is fleeting, so it becomes much more precious. It also opens the possibility of meeting old friends, family, acquaintances, and people we have never even met before. They are in the soil that makes the flower bloom, in the fish for dinner, or in the person that just blurted a rude comment. There is, I believe, a stronger emotional connection outside what is considered the self to the external world. If there is someone we hold dear to others, then perhaps we will think twice about causing harm or holding resentment and become more compassionate people as a result.

Taking all the above, I want to answer the main question. I think that the human species, having gained the power to cause this amount of damage, enough to tread as gently as it can. Reconnect with their ancestral wisdom, making use of the immediate resources at their disposal as best as they can without harming other living beings. There is no room for capitalism here. The dragon that protects the treasure must be slain, for it has taken more than it needs from others. I believe that by raising the standard of life of the humans with the least resources, humanity will benefit. Towards other-than-humans, there is an immeasurable amount of responsibility, for they not only bring benefits that the common people cannot fathom but because living in harmony is beneficial to all parties involved. This is not to turn away from the fact that life is built through death but to respect the sacrifices that occur for life to continue. The rabbit consumes grass to live, and the predator consumes the rabbit to see the next day. Death must not be stopped but unnecessary sacrifices do. What is the point of advancement that depends on the suffering of others? What is the purpose behind creating barriers between human and human, human and animal, and human and the natural world when the well-being of all is interdependent? Life is more colorful when knowing we are part of something bigger that we cannot even fathom and being responsible for the well-being of those in our communities. It gives us a reason for living, a purpose that if we try, we can all fulfill.
