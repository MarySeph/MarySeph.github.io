        <h1>07.03.2024</h1>
            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
            <p>While I was writing the <a href="/dev log/tw-site/07.01.2024.html">previous post</a> I was fiddling
            with the folder system. This system is based on <a href="https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/">Nick Milo's LYT Kit 6 from Linking Your
            Thinking</a>.</p>

            <h2>Part 1: Folder System</h2>
            <div class="container">

            </div>
            
            <p>From top to bottom, this is the current folder system,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inbox
                    <ul>
                        <li>New Ideas</li>

            <blockquote>Note: I'm having second thoughts about this folder structure because I didn't take into account that in the long-term,
            I will need to differentiate between the files that need to be transferred to the TiddlyWiki/Blink file and those
            already transferred. In other words, there are three states the files in this vault will be, to edit, edited and to
            transfer, and transferred. In the end, I decided to leave it to my future self to solve this issue.</blockquote>

            <p>The folder from the top, <strong>+ Inbox</strong> is where I store the files that haven't been edited. <strong>New Ideas</strong> is a folder I have in another vault so I added it here as well. I just deleted that because it
            didn't bring any benefit.</p>
            <p>The Atlas folder, both in this and other vaults, is intended for files that filter the vault's content. In this case,
            the Cooling Pad displays files from the <strong>+ Inbox</strong> folder. This way I don't have to click through files
            and instead use the Cooling Pad to maneuver through the vault. The Cooling Pad is a type of scope so that's why it's inside the
            <strong>Scope</strong> folder.</p>
            <p>The next folder is <strong>Cards</strong>. This folder is for files that make the meat of the vault. Right now, it's not
            very populated. I'll add files related to the Mind Garden. The rule of thumb I use for this folder is to add any note with a
            single idea.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, the thickest folder, <strong>Spaces</strong>. The intention behind this is to add subfolders of about any kind of
            project. Think of it as a workspace but not limited to "work." Perhaps a desk space where you can bring any materials
            and work on any project you want makes more sense. I placed the <strong>Website</strong> subfolder into the <strong>Projects</strong> subfolder. The
            website is divided into what I considered the main categories of content I intend to publish, <strong>Blog</strong>, <strong>Crafts</strong>. <strong>Mind Garden</strong>, and <strong>Web Development</strong>. </p>
            <p>The last three are files, <strong>+ Start Here</strong> is the main page, <strong>+ Documentation</strong> will have
            meta information on the design and process of the creation of this website, and the good old <strong>About</strong> page contains some personal
            information about yours truly.</p>
            <p>After working on the folder system, I edited some more files up to the number I think I have a goo chunk to move on.
            Thus, I will be moving to the next phase of the project, importing the .md files to TiddlyWiki/Blink.</p>
            <p>But before that, I want to make sure to save my current progress on the cloud. I'm using a public repository on <a
                href="https://github.com/MarySeph/MarySeph.github.io">GitHub</a>. I will walk you to the process of saving the files
            using GitHub Desktop, as the initial set-up of the account and software happened a few years ago.</p>
            <p>So because I already have the public repository created, instead of cloning the repository, I created a folder in my
            computer with the same name. Then, in the repo, I created a branch called <strong>md-vault</strong>.</p>
            <div class="container">
                <img src="/images/Screenshot 2024-07-06 18.41.00.PNG" class="img" alt="">
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <img src="/images/Screenshot 2024-07-06 18.46.00.PNG" class="img" alt="">
            </div>
            

            <p>The top underlines text is the name of the repository, the squared text is the name of the branch, and the other
            underlined text is the folder that I'm using with Obsidian.</p>
            <p>To upload the folder, in GithubDesktop, I went to Files > Add local repository and added the folder with the same name
            as the repo. Both folder synced up nicely. After making edits through Obsidian, I commit them and push them to the
            <strong>md-vault</strong>.</p>
            <div class="container">
                <img src="/images/Screenshot 2024-07-06 18.54.00.PNG" class="img" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>It's <i>very</i> important to push the changes to the correct branch.</p>
            <p>To make sure the files are being saved to GitHub, go to the website or load it and make sure the folder has had its
            latest update in the last few seconds and the description matches what was written before committing (lower left corner
            of GitHub Desktop).</p>
            <p>SO! Next time it will be ALL about TiddlyWiki/Blink! Ohhh I'm so excited to use it again and fumble around! See you next
            time!</p>
