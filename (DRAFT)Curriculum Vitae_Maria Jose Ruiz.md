~~Analyzed National Risk Index (NRI)~~
- 2024 Atlantic hurricane season
- Impact
- Gulfport, FL
- Deliverables: Report, presentation

Conducted an in-depth analysis of the actual impacts from the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season on public infrastructure in **[City Name]**, Florida. Used the **National Risk Index** to assess storm-related risks by **census tract**, highlighting areas with the highest vulnerability to storm damage. These insights were supported by a **flood extent map**, which illustrated how storm surge affected different regions, explaining the variation in infrastructure damage across the city.

Highlighted the city's use of nature-based flood-mitigation solutions through a **custom watershed map** to explain how the city is leveraging linked watersheds to reduce flood risk and enhance resilience. These watersheds, created over the decades and connected through underground piping, help channel floodwaters to the bay and mitigate flooding.

Conducted an interview with a local public official to gather additional insights into the most affected areas and discuss the city's ongoing flood-mitigation efforts. The interview helped validate and expand on the data and strategies presented in the report. Focused on effective science communication by synthesizing complex data, maps, and concepts into a clear, accessible format for a non-technical audience.
