---

## Materials:

- Old underwear
- Old socks
- Needle
- Thread
- Scissors

## Methods:

- To repupose underwear as scrap cloth, place the underwear flat on a surface.
- Pinch from the inside the section that meets the crotch and pull it up until it meets the upper edge of the cloth. This keep the crotch section inside the cloth.
- Fold the cloth in half.
- Sew which ever open end you want, the one that hugs the waist or limbs, careful to maintain the shape.
- Sew the remaining end.
- To repurpose socks, place them flat on a surface andÂ shove one inside the other until the ankles meet each other.
- Check if your hand fits.
- Hold onto the ankles and begin to sew across. After each stitch, make sure to stretch the cloth as far as it can go without breaking the shape. You can shove your hand in to test it still fits until you finish sewing.
