# Nitrate Concentrations in Bayboro Harbor


### Abstract

The purpose of this study was to collect, analyze, and present water quality data from Bayboro Harbor. The parameter of interest is nitrate which is part of total nitrogen (TN), a measurement of eutrophication. Over the course of three weeks, water samples at four key sites in relation to two non-point source pollution areas were collected and tested for nitrate. Results indicate that nitrate concentration in these areas is minuscule.

### Introduction

Water quality monitoring is a type of field method that gathers data on a parameter or set of parameters related to the health of a body of water. The largest body of surface water in the Florida West Coast is Tampa Bay which millions of people, animals, and plants rely on. Thus, reliable water quality data is crucial for stakeholders in the decision-making process. One of the threats to Tampa Bay's water quality is eutrophication. Eutrophication is a naturally occurring process over thousands of years that converts water bodies into forests (Chislock, Doster, Zitomer, & Wilson, 2013). In Tampa Bay, eutrophication is historically related to human activity (Greening & Janiki, 2006). Efforts to reverse eutrophication and maintain water quality standards rely on monitoring tools and processes (Wolfe & Drew, 1990).

Marinas and storm drains, due to their direct contact with water, are non-point sources of nutrient pollution (USEPA). Nutrient pollution related to water quality includes, among others, total nitrogen (TN), the sum of all forms of nitrogen in a region (Scott, n.d.). To monitor and assess the levels of nutrient pollution in Tampa Bay, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established the "Numeric Criteria for Nitrogen/Phosphorus Pollution in Florida's Inland Surface Fresh Waters." (Kaufman et al., 2011) This study was conducted in Bayboro Harbor, classified as the Peninsula by Nutrient Watershed Region, which has two non-point sources of pollution, a marina on the south and a storm drain up north (Figure 1). The FDEP classified the area of Sites 1 to 3 as stream, where the TN threshold is currently 1.54ppm; whereas Site 4, at the threshold between the harbor and Middle Tampa Bay, the TN threshold is 1.24ppm (Kaufman et al., 2011).

Environmental scientists and policy professionals, university students coursing through Environmental Field Methods may be interested in this study. This report details the sampling and analysis of water samples and presents the data on their nitrogen concentration. The objective of this study is to sample, analyze, and present data about the nitrate concentration in key points of Bayboro Harbor. Sites were chosen for their proximity to the non-point sources and accessibility.

### Methods

Over the course of three weeks, twelve water samples were collected in four sites, one per week. We followed USEPA 350.1, 353.2, and 353.1 procedures for sample processing, preservation, and analysis, respectively. 4oz bottles and a bucket were used to collect samples. These were rinsed at each site before gathering the sample. After collection, samples were then filtered through a 0.22-micron SIM 511 Nylon Membrane filter, yielding at least five smaller samples per bottle. All filtered samples were frozen until testing.

In reference to USEPA 353.1 method, a stock nitrate solution (14ppm) was used to prepare several dilutions (2.8ppm, 1.4ppm, 0.14ppm). These, alongside a sample of DI water (0ppm), were tested for nitrate (NO3) with the Red Sea Nitrate Pro Test Kit. However, instead of using the comparator for colorimetric testing, the samples were run through a Shimadzu Spectrophotometer. From the resulting absorbance vs. wavelength values, the corrected absorbance at peak wavelength of all standards were calculated. The corrected absorbances and known concentrations were then plotted in an Excel graph displaying the linear regression equation. This formula was then used to calculate the NO3 concentration in the Bayboro water samples that went through the process of nitrate testing and spectrophotometer measurement. The corrected absorbance at peak replaced the x value.

### Results

The resulting formula of the standard solution's corrected absorbance vs. concentration graph was 5.0494x-0.1092.

### Discussion

Results suggest that Nitrate-Nitrogen concentrations may be small enough to be insignificant in comparison to other values that make up the Total Nitrogen in this area. The negative values from all four sites on all three weeks except Site 1-Week 3 suggest low concentrations in Bayboro Harbor are more common than not during the period of the study.

The initial proposal for this study intended to gather and analyze more sources of data related to eutrophication such as chlorophyll a, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen. In addition, a significant result was to present the data in accordance with FDEP standards because of the importance of human and marine health. Such a proposal was overly ambitious considering the length of the study. It is recommended to focus on a single parameter and focus on obtaining valuable experience with sample collecting, storing, and analysis methods. Because the parameter of this study was part of a larger eutrophication measure, future research can focus on another parameter from total nitrogen or any of the ones initially intended (Scott, n.d.). Nevertheless, for those seeking a career in Environmental Science, Field Methods is an important experience regardless of future specialization.
