# Layouts

These layouts were designed using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

## Version 1.1
Designed this around the current layout as of the end of 2024. The main objective was on the desktop version where I want to add columns and display the site's Changelog and the latest content as well as some buttons without affecting accessibility. And because I have been toying with the thought of improving the mobile experience, I want to add a hamburger menu and translate the new design from desktop. Both designs also have a button to change between light and dark mode. I'm not 100% sure about it because if done wrong it may affect the accessibility of the site. There is a dark mode available if the device is set to such. The reason I want to add a button is because in the two Microsoft laptops that I have, turning on dark mode is kind of a pain compared to mobile. In my previous Chromebook and my phone, I can set a time for dark mode but for some reason I can't in my laptop?

## Listfauxgraphy
I downloaded [Kalechip's version](https://kalechips.net/projects/code/listfauxgraphy) of Listfauxgraphy to test. I have no previous experience with the original Listography (which still exists!), so I made a sketch to get familiar with the layout. I'm not sure if I'll use it as a new layout for the web dev commonplace, or for self-care resource, or perhaps for the story I'm making or all three. I like [Summer Storms'](https://summerstorms.me/Thoughts/ListColors) (previously Desert Jaguar) Hydrangea color scheme so I might add it to Kalechips' code. Between the background and color scheme and fonts, this code is highly customizable. The sky is the limit!
