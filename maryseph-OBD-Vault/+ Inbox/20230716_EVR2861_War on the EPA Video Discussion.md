# 20230716_EVR2861_War on the EPA Video Discussion

## The Frontline video "War on the EPA" chronicles the rise of Scott Pruitt from Oklahoma attorney general to EPA Administrator in the Trump Administration. After watching the video and completing the study guide, participate in a discussion with your class peers about Scott Pruitt's political background and motivations for changing energy policy within the EPA.

### 1. Describe in a  few paragraphs why the Obama Administration's focus on energy policy was alarming to the people of middle America and those in the fossil fuel energy sector. For example, what were their primary concerns and how did they contribute to the rise of the Tea Party movement in 2009? Is it fair to state that clean energy policies were destroying the coal industry or were other economic issues hurting coal? (4 points)

**Obama's energy policy**
- Obama wanted to put regulations on the U.S's carbon emmissions from the energy industry (oil, coal, & gas)
- He did this by first wanting to measure the energy industry's emission and bide by the EPA's (federal agency), current regulations of water and air quality.
- This change occured from 2008-2016
- In his 2nd mandate(2012-2016), after failing to get Congress' help to make regulations, he used executive authority to order the EPA to plan and put into action what's known as the Clean Energy Plan
**People of middle America**
- They consist, culturally, on people with a strong federalist culture and resonate strongly with their identity as a state.
- They are also middle class rural communities whose livelihoods are heavily reliant on the enery industry.
- The states in the middle of the U.S felt their livelihoods threatened by Obama's energy policies which was exacerbated by the enery industry's influence in their environment (ex. Americans for Prosperity ads).
**Fossil fuel sector**
- Big oil, coal, and gas companies with great influence in the U.S Midwest.
- Some relevant names in this discussion are: Devon, Murray Energy, and Koch Industry.
- These companies felt threatened because they believe the energy policies were an attack on their bussiness, forcing them to adhere to ever-growing regulations whose motivation they didn't understand nor believe.
- This sector in the Midwest spends a lot of money denying climate change and undermining the results from the scientific community.
- In addition the their energy bussiness, they excert influence on the community they reside in. 
	- For example, they sponsor stadiums, banks, and build tall buildings.
	- The Koch brothers funded a conservative group called Americans for Prospertity. This group ran ads and campaigns against clean energy plans which swayed the local population into believing that the new policies will negatively affect their livelihoods and that the environmental movement is made up of the elite.
**Primary concerns for middle America and fossil fuel sectors**
- The threat on their livelihoods: increased oil prices, potential layoffs, and encroachment of the federal government in their state.
- Fossil fuel sector: Threat to their way of doing things, profit loss, increasing regulations, expensive changes seemly without base.
**Contribution of rise of Tea Party movement 2009**
- The Tea Party movement centers around the federalist mindset of state rights. The federal government shouldn't tell the states what to do. It is most prevalent in the U.S Midwest because historically, people were encouraged to explore the West and build their own lives with little restrictions. Midwest states are characterized by their independence and state identity.
- The movement became stronger because of the perceived threat of Obama's energy policies who were backed, and greatly influenced by energy companies (anti-regulation propaganda).
**"Clean energy policies were destroying the coal industry" or other economic issues hurting coal?**
- I believe that the recession in 2008 must have hit the U.S energy sector. I think it's fair to say that Obama's clean energy policies weren't the only factor that hurt the energy sectory during his administration.
- The documentary briefly mentions that the energy sector was struggling to meet demand because of the new regulations. I think the culture shock, so to speak, was a big factor and hurt itself. The energy sector perceived that it suddenly and rapidly had to change its way of doing things. Because it had never faced such strong opposition and perhaps it wasn't offered, or received, or accepted aid to make these changes, they felt at loss which led them to build resentment fostering a victim mentality. In addition, big oil companies may be built on apathetic attitudes towards disadvantaged groups which doesn't allow them to change their established believes and way of life which I think is based on social and economic priviledge, consumerism, and capitalist values prevalent in the U.S. I think nobody wants to be the bad guy of the story, so their instinct was to deny the perceived accussations and cover their ears.

### 2. Describe in a short paragraph how the Obama Administration changed its strategy for adopting clean energy policies by focusing on executive actions instead of the Legislative Branch.  How did the members of RAGA react to this strategy?  What action did they take and what role did Scott Pruitt play in this action? (4 points)
**Obama's new strategy for clean energy legislation**
Obama's first attempt (2008-2012) to pass clean energy legislation was focused in working with Congress. However, Americans for Prosperity, under Koch Industry, had funded Congress canditates became a Republican majority. These elected officials had pledged to oppose any legislation related to climate change that would increase government revenue. Thus, they wouldn't work with Obama to put into effect any kind of Climate Tax on energy companies.

For his 2nd term (2012-2016), Obama changed his strategy. Because Coungress wouldn't cooperate, he decided to use executive orders where the EPA began to develop the Clean Energy Plan.

**RAGA's reaction to Obama's strategy to get clean energy legislation**
- RAGA, under Pruitt's leadership, acknowledged the need for the energy sector and attorney general to put their heads together and take a stand.

**RAGA's action and Pruitt's role in it**
- Pruitt, at that time part of RAGA's executive board if not chair, along with his companions, led the series of lawsuits from U.S Midwestern states at the EPA's evergrowing environmental regulations.
- As Obama entered his 2nd mandate, RAGA, Pruitt, and the Midwestern energy sector had joined to create a strike force that eventually stopped the implementation of the Clean Energy Plan.


### 3. Describe how Scott Pruitt's leadership role in RAGA led to his nomination by President Trump to the EPA administrator position. Which industry leaders played a role in his nomination and how (be specific)? Based on this, which direction do you think the EPA is headed under the Trump administration? (4 points)

**Pruitt's role in RAGA leading to the nomination for EPA admin**
Pruitt's role in RAGA connected him with oil and gas companies, in particular Southern Company lobbyst Andre Miller who, days before the start of Obama's 2nd mandate, wrote to Pruitt to convene a 2-day meeting between corportations and their lawyers, lobbysts , Pruitt, and other Republican attorney genreals to make an action plan against Obama's environmental regulations. He spearheaded the series of lawsuits against the EPA, including the Clean Energy Plan, stopping it in its tracks at the Supreme Court level. This involvement and connnections to the energy sector were factors that led to his nomination as EPA administrator after Trump's victory.

**Name the relevant industy players and how**
One name in particular stands out, Robert E. Murray, or Bob Murray, from Murray Energy. He met Pruitt back when he was at RAGA. Murray, as he was looking for allies for the next presidential election, he met with Donald Trump. Murray confessed that he gave Trump an action plan soon after his presidential victory. Although he didn't mention it, perhaps he might have suggested Pruitt as a Cabinet member.

Perhaps indirectly or not, other energy companies that may have aided in Pruitt's nomation as EPA admin could be the Koch brothers and Devon Energy. In addition, Myron Ebeil of the Competitive Enterprise Institute as the head of Trump's transition team, could have had a hand in Pruitt's nomination.

**EPA's direction under Trump's admin**
While at the time of writing this assignment Trump's administration has ended, his influence on the EPA are marked in history. I believe that Murray, Trump, and Pruitt's cooperation rolledback or stumped a lot of environmental regulations. For example, Trump's immediate withdrawal from the Paris Agreement must have given energy companies free reins on pollution levels. In addition, he lessed rules for offshore drilling. These are examples of Trump's anti-regulation administration. Then, to hypothesize, as many of Trump's circle would benefit from climate denial, the EPA aka Pruitt's inner circle would have this mentality, influencing major decisions of this key federal agency whose mission is to protect the health of its constituents the U.S's natural resources. Finally, I think Trump's EPA, as seen in many important government decisions, affects vulnerable populations the most. Deregulation on pollution limits has a cascade effect in newborns, general human health, and aging.

### 4. Respond (in a few sentences) to another student's comments either agreeing or disagreeing (respectfully) and why. (3 points)
