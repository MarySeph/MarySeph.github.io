# 2024 Scrappy Crochet Christmas Presents
Start date: 12/14/2024; End date: 12/20/2024.

This project will be different from others where I drop a bunch of information about small projects. I want to use my yarn scraps for small Christmas presents this year and I would love to document and share this! I have bought a lot of yarn this year and I'm actively holding myself back from buying more and using up what I have.

I'm working with a limited number of yarn balls I chose to bring beforehand. I have some color schemes in mind but if a color runs out, they may be paired with something that looks a little off.

### Materials
- Hook: 5.0mm and 6.0mm
- Scissors
- Yarn needle

### Yarn
- A: Lily's Sugar and Creme, Scrubby, color Pretty Purple.
- B: Allegro, Tango, color Blanco.

- D: Peaches and Creme, Original, color Sunshine.
- E: Peaches and Creme, Original, color Royal Blue.
- F: Allegro, Tango, color Crudo.
- G: Allegro, Tango, color Cafe.

### Notes:
I love making small items with cotton yarn. I think there's something lovely about getting a handmade every day item. I like to make handtowels, dishtowels, and scrubbies, and other household items.

I had this video pattern saved for a long time and I wanted to change the bath sponge I used so I decided to make a test for myself and make more as gifts.

In general, I tried to keep the yarn on the weight 4 category. This an all other projects will be made with cotton yarn.

The mix of colors and the strap are the only modification I made.

Some people in my family are devoted catholics. So when I saw this pattern from Hopeful Turns, I thought they would like this to use while reading the Bibles or something.

### Materials
- 3.5mm hook
- Yarn needle
- Scissors

### Yarn
- L: Online Garne, Linie 345 - Cotton Baby Colors, color Berry Mix. 

### Notes:
This is one of those yarn which I bought without a pattern in mind and brought me a lot of grief. I love love loveeee the colors but they aren't something I would work with to make something for myself, so all the projects I have used this yarn for were gifts. Another thing that made this yarn hard to use was that I didn't have anyone in mind to gift whatever I made this yarn to. This was a one off use because I bought it abroad so I sure learned by lesson to not buy yarn just because!

### Materials
- 3.5mm hook
- Yarn needle
- Scissors

### Yarn
- L: Online Garne, Linie 345 - Cotton Baby Colors, color Berry Mix. 
- M: Silvia Copo, color 3432 - Fucsia.
- N:Allegro, Vals, 8/12 color Blanco.

### Notes:
With this project I managed to use up both of those yarn balls! The pattern called for a 4 weight but I used 2 weights so you can imagine how long this took! I ran out of yarn at the last row so I used up other yarn with similar colors as the base yarn.

I'm beginning to notice that I don't enjoy patterns where small mistakes end up messing up the stitch count. I spent a whole day modifying this patters by half winging it on a swatch and translating it to such a long row count was soooo stressful! The single crochet rows felt like FOREVER but the double crochet rows went by fast. If I were to do this pattern next time, I would use a larger hook and yarn size... Definitely not a fan of big projects made with anything thinner than a 4 weight.... I have much more respect towards people who make sweaters and larger pieces of clothing. It's a commitment.

### Materials
- 5.0mm hook
- Yarn needle
- Scissors

### Yarn
- O: Allegro, Tango, color 8/6 Blanco.
- P: Lily's Sugar and Creme, The Original, color White.
- Q: Allegro, Vals, 8/12 color Turquesa.
- N: Allegro, Vals, 8/12 color Blanco.

### Notes:
The final project, good grief! Even after all of these, I still had a good chunk left! I just winged this one, testing for size. It's palm sized and I have a strand long enough to feel substantial but not enough to do something with it so I'm putting that in the stuffing stash.

I didn't have a self-imposed deadline but there's other things I want to do during this break and I was running out of yarn so I whipped this up out of pure weariness and frustration. I think I'll give it to my brother to use as a whiteboard eraser as he doesn't have one.

I do like how it came out though. I added the borders and the strap with colors Q and N to use up those weight 3 scrap yarn. This is quite the Frankenstein-monster-esque project, haha, and one of those cases where one falls back into the patterns they know by heart without thinking too much about it. I'm satisfied with the result!
