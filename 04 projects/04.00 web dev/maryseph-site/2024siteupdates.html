    <h2>December 27th, 2024</h2>
    <p>Last update of the year! Hopefully. I have been working on this site almost non-stop. The biggest changes can be
        easily
        found in the nav and footer. For starters, I made about pages of the webmaster and the site! The latter leads to the
        <a href="/02 web dev/neocities-site/updatearchive.html">update archive</a> and a <a href="">layouts</a> page.
        Because of those changes, <a href="/02 web dev/neocities-site/siteplans.html">Dev Log: Neocities Site</a> only has
        site
        plans. Kalechips and seafare's sites were a great reference for these changes. Many thanks. Last but not least, the
        <a href="/04 crafts/2024xmas-presents.html">2024Xmas Presents</a> crochet projects are complete.
    </p>
<h2>December 16th, 2024</h2>
<p>MASSIVE update! <a href="/04 crafts/crafts.html">Crafts</a> and <a href="https://maryseph.atabook.org/">Guestbook</a>
    in the nav bar are now available.
    With this, all items in the nav now lead to somewhere! In the crafts page, I added some WIPs. The guestbook is made
    with atabook.org.
    I also added a visitor counter, a clap button, and two stickers to the main page.
    Last but not least, I resized the iframe this page shows in the main page and styled the scrollbar.</p>
<h2>December 5th, 2024</h2>
<p><a href="/02 web dev/webdev.html">Web Dev page</a> has been cleaned up! A small change that makes the page tidier.
    I moved Site Plans and Stuff to Fix sections from the <a href="/02 web dev/webdev-commonplace.html">web dev
        commonplace</a> to <a href="/02 web dev/neocities-site/neocities-site.html">this site's dev log.</a>
    and added some new stuff like a link to the source code, a template, and the CSS variables for my color scheme!</p>
<p>In the commonplace notebook you can still find web dev resources, links to site I like, and web rings/cliques.</p>
<h2>December 1st, 2024</h2>
<p>Color scheme in light mode makes it easier to distinguish text with urls in list!
    That's one item off the accessibility issues checked off!
</p>
<h2>November 26th, 2024</h2>
<p>I added <a href="/">a new short story</a>! I also created a commonplace for <a href="/06 links/nia.html">nature
        inspired art</a>!
    On other news, updated <a href="/02 web dev/webdev-commonplace.html">web dev commonplace</a> with another cool site
    and a new cool resource blogging.</p>
<h2>November 16th, 2024</h2>
<p>Refocusing my efforts in writing and making that available in <a href="/03 writing/writing.html">here</a>.
    New <a href="/01 now/now.html">Now</a> entry.
    <a href="/06 links/links.html">Links</a> page is now available. It has buttons leading to other sites and a single
    webring I managed to apply to.
</p>
<h2>October 30th, 2024</h2>
<p>Finished updating the whole website with the new layout.
    Checked off a bunch of items from my <a href="/02 web dev/webdev-commonplace.html">site plans</a> such as a site
    updates log (you're here!), a site map (see footer), using a minimalist layout, introducing iframes, and an
    accessibility statement (see footer).</p>
<p>Two important items left for accessibility are <u>adding alt text to images</u> and seeing whether to <u>add an
        option to manually change to
        dark mode.</u>
<p>Welp, I had some free time added alt text and tested the dark mode. I'll keep the latter in the background for now.
    I also updated the <a href="/02 web dev/webdev-commonplace.html">commonplace notebook with more sites and
        resources.</a></p>
<p>Next might be setting up a guestbook and a links page.</p>
</p>
<h2>October 28th, 2024</h2>
<p>I finished what I consider the version 0 of this site two weeks ago.
    I took a week off probably due to burnout and shiny new thing syndrome.</p>
<p>Today I'm back and highly-motivated.
    My main objective was to made another version of the homepage in a more minimalist style.
    A secondary objective was to decide on color schemes for light mode and mode. Both objectives were accomplished.
    The site is very blue.</p>
<p>Next, I would like to add a button to switch between these modes but I should test without it myself and see whether
    it's really necessary.</p>
