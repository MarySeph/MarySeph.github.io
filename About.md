What do you want to know about me from this page? It seems like at some point I was able to write these types of pages but nowadays I draw a blank when typing profile descriptions.

Who am I? As far as it concerns to this website, I am creative individual documenting and showcasing arts and crafts. Like many others who gravitate to the indie web, large-scale online social spaces brought some form of discomfort. My experience was filled with struggles to share my creative works in platforms where the light shone on reactionary and derivative content. While as a adult I understand the need to market my talents to future employers, I didn't want that to be the case with casual online accounts.

I was born in 1998, the time in between the decentralized web and grew up as Facebook, Twitter and other major social media where establishing themselves.

The person behind this website promises to design it as responsive and accessible as possible. This site is both a corner of the web to nurture treasured creative efforts for the future as well as a research project of design principles and web culture of the past.

As mentioned in [[Home]], the main focus of this site are creative efforts in web development (aka stuff that feeds the look of this site), writings (only fiction), and crafts (mostly crochet, to be honest).

What else? In [[Writing]], you're likely to find stories set in modern times or heavily-inspired in different cultures. I'm delving into low-fantasy settings with heavy themes such as gender, sexuality, and neurodivergence. Stories will be labeled with ratings, content warnings, and other information I deem potentially upsetting. In general, expect to read something at least recommended for teens.

As for crafts, I mainly do crochet. This is one of those things that would be great to share on major social media but as someone who struggles with perfectionism and likes taking pictures and editing, the amount of work, in my mind, seems so daunting. I also wanted to write long form content and I didn't want to use Instagram like that. Plus, I want to own what I write (that doesn't include what belongs to other creators), so this website is great for that.
