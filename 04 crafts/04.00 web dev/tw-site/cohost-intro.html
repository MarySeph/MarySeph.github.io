    <h1>Introduction, Goals, and Game Plan</h1>
    <p>I decided to use cohost as place to record and share my progress in software development and non-fiction writing.
        Expect
        long posts and a lot of rambling. I'll be working with the garage door up, also known as <a
            href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">learning in
            public</a> and because I want to be as transparent as possible, I will also share the
        tools and processes behind the outputs.</p>
    <p>So, what's the game plan? I am applying the method described in <a
            href="https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/resolutions_vs_intentions?_pos=1&_sid=eeadf8848&_ss=r">Plans
            vs Goals vs Resolutions vs Intentions</a> from
        Ryder Caroll's bulletjournal.com.</p>

    <h2>Intention - The Why</h2>
    <p><i>> commitment to a process</i></p>
    <p>I want to improve my writing skills. Writing is an effective tool to sharpen my thinking, and the record it
        leaves
        behind is useful for future projects. Perhaps most importantly, I want to write to create meaningful work. I
        hope that
        what I create reaches other people who will find it impactful or useful.</p>

    <h2>Goal - The What</h2>
    <p><i>> definition of an outcome</i></p>
    <p>At the moment, I have two projects:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Web development</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to develop and deploy my own website. I have tinkered with one before but I want to build on and
                improve it.</li>
            <li>This section include the development and deployment of mind gardens.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Non-fiction Writing</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Blog posts, notes, observations, I'm not use what to call them nor how I'm going to share them.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Plan - The How</h2>
    <p> <i>> definition of a process</i></p>
    <p>The the meat of the pie. My website is <a href="https://github.com/MarySeph/MarySeph.github.io">currently being
            deployed through Github as an index.html
            file</a>. Now I have a non-Chrome device, I want to tinker with Netlify for
        deployment and Gatsby or Jekyll for front-end development. My education with web development started is rather
        basic, so
        I will be sharing everything that I have learned and knowledge required to produce your own. In the same link as
        above,
        there will be blank copy of the file I will build the new website off which is the same as the mind gardens.</p>
    <p>These mind gardens are small, concentrated writing projects around a topic. One is <a
            href="https://maryseph.github.io/Happiness-The-Meaning-of-Life-A-Philosophy-Mind-Garden/">already
            available</a> for your scrolling pleasure.</p>
    <p>At last but not least, random pieces of writing will come out in either this account or in the website. They may
        be
        short. They may be long. They may not make a lot of sense. The website takes priority.</p>
    <p>To summarize, the purpose of this account is to record and share the development of different pieces of writing
        including but not limited to front-end web development and non-fiction writing.</p>
    <p>I want to join the <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">/now page movement</a> and add something like that to either
        this account or the
        website.</p>
