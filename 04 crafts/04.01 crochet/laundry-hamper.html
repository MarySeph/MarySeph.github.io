    <p>Unfinished at the time of writing these notes, this project came to be as a personal challenge. I don't usually buy yarn
    in bulk nor multiple balls of the same lot. I wanted to make this laundry hamper not only because I felt I needed one;
    the one I currently use is an acrylic mesh one whose strap has snapped before and I feel it will give out any day. This
    thing isn't to be trusted. So I wanted a laundry hamper with the same portability with increased durability, no wires,
    no fabric.</p>
    <p>I bought a set of six balls of color A and three balls of color B. It was also Thanksgiving holiday. I gave myself
    permission to take part in the consumerism culture for once (I didn't last year) but not really but one could make the
    argument this project wasn't <i>urgent</i>. Anyways.</p>
    <p>I'm almost done with the bag. I ended up using two balls of Color A and four balls of Color B. ...I forgot to add the
    strap to close it, HAHA! Okay, I just finished attaching the strap (feels different after sewing all the straps for the
    new version of the <a href="/04 crafts/04.01 crochet/grannybag.html">Granny Stitch String Bag</a>). This is another why having a crafts notebook is VERY important! One
    forgets things... For the drawstring, I'm reusing a chord from another bag, maybe.
    </p>
    <p>I attached the strap on the wrong side. the mouth of the bag is supposed to be on the inside. I really don't feel like
    taking it off and reattaching so we going like this till I can't deal with it. The grey strap also greatly contrasts
    with the rest of the project. It bothers me. But I don't want to make another one so. Yeah! Great project, might fix
    some silly mistakes, might not. Thanks for reading!
