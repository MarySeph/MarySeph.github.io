    <h2>January 27th, 2025</h2>
    <p>Whoop whoop, what a strange place to be! The home of this had been neocities for the past four months. While I'm writing
    on the markdown version, I'm updating this site, from <a href="https://maryseph.github.io/">Github Pages</a>! Not gonna lie, it feels much more lonely. But as I
    explained <a href="/02 blog/03 longform/smp-cleanup.html">here</a> one of the goals from starting my own website was to make it slightly
    more professional. The kind of website I can share with people in real life and is tied to my... government identity I
    guess, for lack of a better term.</p>
    <p>To summarize that behemoth of a page, what's going to happen from now on is that this site will continue to be hosted on
    GitHub Pages. That means the site in Neocities will not be updated. That's all you need to know. Welcome to MY site! A
    slightly less self-indulgent than the previous one. Look forward to big-brained arguments. I'm going full PKM with this
    one and there's no turn back.</p>
