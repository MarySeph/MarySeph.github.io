# Privacy

As I host this site on Github, there might be some privacy-related things I should probably tell you about but I haven't looked into it yet. For a bit of background, Github is owned by Microsoft which is a large tech corporation. Their respective privacy policies may apply to your browsing of this site. I'll add the links soon.
