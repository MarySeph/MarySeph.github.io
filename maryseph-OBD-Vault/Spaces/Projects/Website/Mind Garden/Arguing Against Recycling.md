# Arguing Against Recycling

Recycling is the modification of some type of product into another. Sustainable waste management practices have expanded from the well-know 3 Rs: Reduce, Reuse , Recycle. Four more Rs have been added and a hierarchy was put in place:

1. Rethink
2. Refuse
3. Reduce
4. Reuse
5. Repair
6. Regift
7. Recycle

As you can see, recycle is the last of *seven* options down the waste management stream which are more accessible to the public than ever before. Thus, for the purpose of this assignment, my posture is that there are other options to manage waste that don't require the energy, technology, and economic fragility of recycling and its market.
