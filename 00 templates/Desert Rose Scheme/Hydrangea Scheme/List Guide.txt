Basic list code:

Code:
<!--LIST--><div class="COLORNAME">
<div class="head"><span class="title">TITLE <span class="subtitle">(subtitle)</span></span></div>
<div class="listcontent">
<div id="listtext">LIST TEXT</div>
</div>
<div class="foot">DATE CREATED &infin;<br>DATE UPDATED +</div>
<!--END LIST--></div>

Where: 
for column one: after <!--COLUMN ONE LISTS GO AFTER THIS NOTE--> or after another list in the same column
for column two: after <!--COLUMN TWO LISTS GO AFTER THIS NOTE--> or after another list in the same column
for column three: after <!--COLUMN THREE LISTS GO AFTER THIS NOTE--> or after another list in the same column

Replace:
COLORNAME should be replaced with the name of one of the color themes, example: dusk
TITLE should be replaced with the list title
SUBTITLE should be replaced with your list subtitle
LIST TEXT should be replaced with your custom text
DATE CREATED
DATE UPDATED

Notes:
The LIST TEXT area is the only area that will automatically do line-breaks, so be sure your LIST TEXT has it's div codes on the same lines as your text. 
example:
<div id="listtext">Line one
Line two
Line three</div>
Make sure those divs are hugging your text.

Insertables:

- List icon
Code: <img src="IMAGE URL" class="listicon">
Where: between <div id="listtext"> and your custom list text (don't add line-breaks)
Replace: IMAGE URL with your image's actual url

- Thumbnail that shows full image when clicked
Code: <div class="listimage" onclick="resizeImage(this)"><img src="IMAGE URL"></div>
Where: in the LIST TEXT area
Replace: IMAGE URL with your image's actual url
Notes: Don't put a blank line between this and any text underneath if you want the spacing
to only be one line. Div's add a line break after them by default.

- Traditional bulleted list
Code:
<ul><li>ITEM ONE</li>
<li>ITEM TWO</li>
<li>ITEM THREE</li></ul>
Notes: Traditional lists automatically add a line break afterward. If you want text directly underneath it without it putting a line inbetween, put your after text directly after </ul>.
Example:
<ul><li>ITEM ONE</li>
<li>ITEM TWO</li>
<li>ITEM THREE</li></ul> AFTER TEXT
