# Reflecting on Overnight Stay at Boyd Hill Reserve

My experience at Boyd Hill was nothing short of healing and relaxing. While I soon realized that I had the mindset of a vacation, it is not an opportunity I take lightly, even less as a college student away from home.

I have realized something important about non-solo vacations and trips, they are an opportunity to interact with the people around in a different setting which for unknown reasons always leads to new discoveries about their characters, experiences, and interests. This has been my experience in the last few years where taking trips with people that I wasn't used to led me to see new sides of themselves.

My primary takeaway from this trip was the connection I built with my peers. I had the most _wonderful_, enriching conversations in a long time. I _thrive_ in them and I feel like I left as a wiser, more compassionate person than before. In seeing new sides of themselves, I also found something in their reflection. The truth is that I have been struggling to build connections with my peers due to my needs. I was aware I wasn't alone, yet I also made a lot of excuses for the lack of intellectual stimulation I was depriving myself of. While I don't have the most fulfilling college life, engaging with my professors has also made me a wiser, and more compassionate person.

Like the song says, "No se ve, pero siento que algo en mi esta cambiando" or "It's intangible, but I feel something inside of me is changing." These lyrics summarize my spiritual takeaways from this trip. I open writing about the connections I forged with my peers because I had the impression that the narrative of "man vs. nature" is being pushed and I had to offer a counterargument. Man _is_ nature. We _are_ nature. Nature _is_ within _us_. Thus, I saw where my impulses took me and I spent most of my time engaging with others, and there wasn't time to say it all. My family has taught me the value of a good conversation and my experiences on campus have been that there isn't time, or it is the place itself that doesn't lend to the conversation that I held on to this trip. I believe it is the former, for I am sure if I give myself permission and the time to engage with others, I will be able to connect.

Building on the idea of connection, as someone raised outside the United States with English as a Second Language, talking to people was a unique opportunity to improve on my speaking and comprehension skills. I spoke at a quality that surprised me then. I felt I was on equal footing both in language and cultural understanding, for I was able to ask questions about things I didn't understand which led me to another takeaway.

We don't know everything and failing to ask "stupid questions" is such a disservice and even an insult to the people we talk to. If something isn't clear, we _must_ ask for clarification, not let it pass. Doing otherwise is _rude_, for it comes across as apathetic, and nothing kills connections as much as apathy. Thus, being honest about my own ignorance, others taking the time to teach, and me being engaged in that teaching was _so_ humbling. Putting the _damn_ effort was _so_ humbling, and it made me realize that teaching and ignorance are great ways to build connection. After being taught, I chose to reciprocate with my own knowledge, contributing to the conversation and _their_ knowledge. It makes our experiences become richer and expands our perceptions of the world, for we realize not only is there so much more to learn but it takes us away from our preconceptions and biases, putting them in a non-judgmental space to be taken apart.

And this, _this_ is where I found connection with nature. I found it in accepting my ignorance, in the kindness and patience of those willing to take their time to teach me, and in my efforts to give something in return. To me, my peers were unknown, being from a place and culture that eludes me. They seem as wild as the oak tree or the ant, and I was present for them. I was engaged in a level that I cannot be thankful enough for and can only pray to be able to taste the sweet nectar of knowledge and connection soon enough. It cannot come soon enough, for I am already starving.

This is but a glimpse of the intangible lessons of this class that I hope to elaborate on the final reflection, to not speak about the meaninglessness of names as labels and their importance in building connections and the destruction of other barriers that obstruct the forging of genuine human connection, no matter their length or strength.

About the perceived intent of this trip, the immersive activities in nature. I found the non-human species we observed to be inspiring. What Arsimmer Mc-Coy represented on the panel, an artist in nature, was a memory that came back to me a few times. It made me reorganize and search for my knowledge of art, instances where art has been the main inspiration. Yes, many artists in the Enlightenment and paintings in museum are those of nature landscapes such as Van Gogh and the group of independent artists he belong to. However, I struggled to come up with more recent examples. It is evidence for anthropocentrism, how art has been focusing on human relationships. I do enjoy those a lot, and I recall my creative writing knowledge of crafting conflict is "man vs. nature" with nature as the antagonist. I haven't seen many examples of this, and I believe nature-inspired art, like Arsimmer Mc-Coy, ought to be important. Art can build connections and framing impressions. What about art inspired by climate change or global warming? I believe that photography has become the dominant art in this area, and I would love to see other types of art take the stage as well. What about painting, plays, MUSIC! Fiction, poetry (The Ghost Dance!), and many others. I am most excited about music because I know of many examples. Skilled musicians can portray an image, such as the flight of a bird, the fall of sakura petals, The Planets, and many others. I will continue to seek nature inspired art and consider making my own apart from photography. The following is one of my favorite pictures from the trip:

This is not the first time I have observed nature like this. I am unsure why I find this beautiful, but I wanted to share nevertheless and make this reflection more creative by adding another piece of media.

As for my prescenciality during the trip, I scratched the surface with the introduction. I conclude that I was able to be in the present moment as much as my body was physically capable. My brain was ready to absorb massive amounts of environmental and social stimulation and stored it for processing. I observed, thought, and analyzed what I could. I did not think that the sounds nearby as a bother, for such urban noise is part of my everyday environment both on campus and home. I think the opposite may be true for me, that the quiet is a little unsettling, but I may grow to become comfortable if exposed to it enough.

The night hike was particularly fascinating. I was immediately reminded of a similar experience, where the perceived danger from nature woke up those survival instincts. I once again noticed that all my brain needed to function was for my eyes to differentiate the outline of the objects and their shades. It was an exercise in blindness and deprivation of sight, a test for what my body really needed to survive. During the night hike, details were out of the picture, thus my brain made of the bare minimum, vague outlines, to carry forward. This experience made me respect the capabilities of my body and feel its wildness, for I didn't trip on any branches nor fall to the ground. It also felt so much shorter than the day hike even though it was a whole hour! I feel that the diminished eyesight allowed my brain to rely on the other senses. Usually, the information that enters my eyes dominates all other environmental stimuli, yet my body is unwilling to be without sight, so I appreciate what this opportunity allowed my body to experience. I _so_ look forward to the next time.

To wrap up this reflection, I will discuss wilderness. As someone with differing perceptions of nature, I found my experience to be very much in nature. My family tends to take short vacations in a small beach town. My parents have been going there since they were children with their parents. I have seen the town change throughout my life and the pictures of their youth. It is a small beach town way away from the main ones. Few schools, adults who go to other towns to work, children running on the streets, the same vendors, one Christian church, and one religious boarding school. My experiences in nature resemble those of American wilderness; it is a place we go to escape our worries and the noise of the urban world. It is a place of rest. However, I cannot put into words the _difference_ between our perceptions. Any trip to an "undeveloped" area with enough "nature" _is_ wild. It is why my trip to Lima, Peru, the capital felt like being in the wilderness. There were so many communal parks and there were trees on the sidewalks and mushrooms grew in the lawn. The infrastructure where I live has truly depraved me of nature that the sight of enough plants, water, and animals _is_ wild because I have been robbed of all those wonderful sights. So, I go to the park instead of my backyard because there isn't sufficient grass nor trees to behold, nor water or animals to be considered a "full natural ecosystem" even though it is not. I must do this despite considering the ants and insects and other species that live in my house and my companions that are just as wild as I am because I think this is not our true home. We were robbed of it, and we continue to be harmed by this so-called human development that is nothing short of destruction.

The areas of Boyd Hill were wild because there were plants, critters, water, and other elements that make a "natural" ecosystem. It is wild enough for me.
