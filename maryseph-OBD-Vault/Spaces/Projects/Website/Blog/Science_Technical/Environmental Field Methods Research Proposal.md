# Environmental Field Methods Research Proposal

## Justification - Why?

We are going to study Bayboro Harbor. We will focus on two non-point source pollution sites, the marina and the storm drain. Our hypothesis is that in these sites, nitrogen, phosphate, and/or chlorophyll a levels are above water quality standards. This question is relevant because of the potential effects in the eutrophication levels of this water body which affects both marine and life on land.


## Background - Where?

Bayboro Harbor is a body of water connected to Lake Maggiore and Old Tampa Bay. This area was declared "dead" in the 50s due to high levels of eutrophication. Since then, mitigation programs have been put into place which has allowed marine life to recuperate (Greening, 2006). However, increased population growth and fertilizer runoff from crop fields are once again deteriorating the health of this ecosystem and with it. Nutrient runoff from non-point source pollution ()

## Work Plan - What? How?

In this study, we will measure nitrate-nitrogen, phosphate, light penetration, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a levels at different location in relation to the marina and the storm drain. We will use an AQUATROLL Y500 sonde to measure DO and chlorophyll a; a secchi disk for light penetration; and finally, the 5849 TestTab Water Investigation Kit to obtain nitrate-nitrogen and phosphate measurements. Locations for sampling will be performed with random sampling denoted by VSP suggestions.

After collecting measurements, they will be inputted and analyzed with ArcGIS, a Geographic Information Systems software. 

## Products

Expected results from this study will provide reliable data on measurements that are related to eutrophication levels--nitrate-nitrogen, phosphate, light penetration, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a--at Bayboro Harbor. Presentation of this data through GIS mapping may allow informed decisions to be performed on
