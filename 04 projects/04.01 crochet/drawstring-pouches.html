    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hook: 4.5mm</li>
        <li>Scissors</li>
        <li>Stitch marker</li>
        <li>Yarn needle</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Yarn</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Color A: Lily's Sugar and Creme, Original, color British Blue.</li>
        <li>Color B: Lion Brand, 24/7 Cotton, color Ecru.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>The amount of those two yarns has been more than enough to make a massive <a href="/04 projects/04.01 crochet/laundry-hamper.html">Laundry Hamper</a>, a <a href="/04 projects/04.01 crochet/meshbag.html">Mesh Bag</a> and these two little projects. I'm throwing them together because I'm writing this a while after finishing them and because they are remakes of previous projects. In other words, I had leftover yarn so I made new pouches for my laptop charger, phone, headphone and portable batter chargers. The first versions were made with cheap acrylic yarn about two years ago when I started crocheting.</p>
    <p>The pattern pouch for the laptop charger starts with five rounds of sc, followed by three rounds of hdc with color A. This makes the base. Then, I switched to color B and made one round of sc to start the body. In the next eleven rounds,
    I used the V-stitch (2dc in same st, ch, sk next st, repeat) also known as the granny stitch but with clusters of 2 hdc instead of 3. Then, I switched back to color A and made four rounds of sc for the rim. With the same color, I made the holes for the drawstring. Give or take, the pattern was dc, ch 3, sk 3, repeat. Lastly, I polished the rim with one final round of sc with 2 sc in each ch 3 sp. I made the strap with color B, threaded it around the holes, and tied it!</p>
    <p>The smaller pouch follows a similar build, a base, the body, and the rim with the same alternating color scheme.</p>
