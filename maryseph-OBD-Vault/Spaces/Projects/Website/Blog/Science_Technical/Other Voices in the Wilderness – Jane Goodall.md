# Other Voices in the Wilderness – Jane Goodall

Jane Goodall stands as one of the world's top figures of holistic environmentalism. Appointed as a United Nations Messenger of Peace at the beginning of the century, she travels around the world sharing a message of hope and union between humans and the natural world.

Born in a small, English town in the 60s, Jane Goodall grew up with a fascination for nature and Africa. In her 20s, she had the chance to travel to Gombe, where she was given the opportunity to do behavioral research on chimpanzees. After a breakthrough, she caught the eye of National Geographic and soon after, the world. Throughout the years, she has been an inspiration to girls and women, researchers, and youth around the world. She advocates for a relation of reciprocity between human societies and the natural world, to flourish together instead of one-sided exploitation. She acknowledges the vestiges of European colonialism in developing countries as a factor of their struggles for subsistence, and the worldwide cycle of abuse of people and the environment. While her work has taken her from Gombe, to the U.S, and finally across the world, Jane Goodall has made a substantial impact on the U.S environmental movement. Her key contributions are her **primate behavioral research**, the **Jane Goodall Institute**, and **its affiliated youth movement, Roots, and Shoots**.

Jane Goodall's ground-breaking research on primate behavior led to the discovery that _humans are not the only species with culture, emotions, and social bonds._ In the 1960s, where women in science and female field researchers were unheard of, Jane Goodall was part of a small research team in Gombe, Tanzania, fulfilling her dream of studying chimpanzees. She was a follower of paleontologist Louis Leakey's theory that there may be a connection between the behaviors of human ancestors and that of great apes. The team found that the chimpanzees of Gombe displayed several behaviors considered exclusive to the human species. Some of these behaviors are toolmaking, mourning, and camaraderie **(Goodall, 2010)**. The chimpanzees of Gombe make tools out of a bare stem to fish termites out of their nest, mourn for their deceased mothers, and reassure each other through hugs and kisses.

The discovery of chimpanzees as toolmakers brought her to the eyes of the National Geographical Society, who through a grant gave her then opportunity to continue her studies, which eventually led her to attend Cambridge University to obtain a Ph.D. in ethology, the study of animal behavior **(Goodall, 2010)**. She continued to publish her findings through National Geographic magazine and penned her first biographical works, one which became an instant international best seller. Then, in 1965, National Geographic Society produced "Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees," bringing her work and discoveries to many families across the United States **(Goodall, 2010)**.

National Geographic and later the foundation that would help fund primate research in Gombe, the Jane Goodall Institute, were her first connections with the United States, the beginnings of Jane, the Animal Welfare Activist, led her to become a participant in its political system.

After a conference in Chicago where chimpanzee experts all around the world gathered to celebrate Jane Goodall's newest work, "The Chimpanzees of Gombe" and share their research, the issues of habitat loss and quality of care in biomedical facilities of chimpanzees was a shared concern. Jane Goodall, along with many allies, sought to focus on the second issue, leaving her research in Gombe in the capable hands of her colleagues. She approached the issue from two fronts, the law, and the people **(Goodall, 2001)**. On the one hand, she and her colleages, along with U.S. Senators who sympathized with the cause, sought to change the legal status of chimpanzees under the Endangered Species Act from "threatened" to "endangered" **(Goodall, 2001)**. This would force the U.S. to tighten the restrictions around chimpanzee imports due to the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES) **(Goodall, 2001)**. On the other hand, Jane Goodall, being a worldwide authority, met with the researchers of several biomedical facilities in the U.S. to discuss improving the quality of care of the chimps **(Goodall, 2001)**. Many listened to her advice, such as LEPSIM labs in New York. Others, such as the National Institute of Health (NIH), were adamant to continue running their operations as is. Both labs held a massive number of chimps, between eighteen hundred to sixty thousand **(Goodall, 2001)**. The struggle to improve the lives of captive chimps was a hard-won compromise. As U.S.'s political history shows, many times, political decisions are made by considering financial power of the sides involved.

Just like Jane Goodall went face-to-face with the managers of these labs, so did she had the opportunity to directly influence and support other stakeholders.

Roots and Shoots is a Jane Goodall affiliated program that seeks to empower youth and provide them with resources to better their communities through a holistic, practical approach. From elementary school to university students, Roots and Shoots members design local projects for people, animals, and the environment, fostering compassionate leadership, increasing involvement with their communities, and giving young generations the greatest tool to face the greatest issues of our time, hope **(Roots & Shoots)**. The program is designed to foster nine traits of Compassionate Leadership: Introspectiveness, Act with Purpose, Critically Thinking, Empathy, Collaboration & Open Communication, Team Player, Inspiration for Peers, Hopeful & Optimistic, Adaptable & Resilient **(Roots & Shoots)**.  Since its inception, Roots and Shoots groups and projects have been formed in over 120 countries. No matter how big or small the project, providing the youth with the tools and knowledge to solve issues is an incredible power. Helplessness is the seed of cynicism which fruits in apathy. For humanity to survive, change needs to happen now. The present and the future need resilient and optimistic people, people that will not let the chaotic media get a hold of them with the bombardment of issue after issue, local, national, and global.

By virtue of being alive, treading in this world, we have a responsibility to our communities and other-than-human neighbors. Jane Goodall's story is inspirational. Her research tore through Western science's conviction of a difference in nature between humans and animals. By bridging the gap between humans and our closest relatives, she makes us question our perception of other-than-human living beings. She went from researcher to animal welfare advocate, using her expertise and authority to communicate the needs of the chimpanzees she loved. Joining hands with many other researchers and politicians, they sought avenues to help the captive chimp that had lost its freedom and home. Then, she turned to young people, and just like her mother encouraged her love for chimps and Africa, she supported their desire to become changemakers, giving them the tools and resources to become compassionate leaders in their own right.

Jane Goodall's work doesn't seem to be over. Apart from meeting with Roots & Shoots groups around the world and the people continuing her work, Jane Goodall, as a UN Messenger of Peace, shares her conviction that humanity can overcome the current global issues, that we can build relations of reciprocity and live alongside not only our closest relatives, but every other living thing in this beautiful world.
