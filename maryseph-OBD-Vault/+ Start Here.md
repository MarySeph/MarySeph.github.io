Hello! Welcome to this site. This is a place for me to share pieces of writing. From research and reflection papers, to development logs, this site is being built and updated in across time.

Following the philosophy of [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), I have been creating sites using [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) for a couple of years. My best work so far is a digital garden for an Honors course summarizing many of the concepts and people who contributed to the topic. I'm very proud of it so please [take a look!](https://maryseph.github.io/Happiness-The-Meaning-of-Life-A-Philosophy-Mind-Garden/).

There are several ways to navigate this website. You can use the left sidebar's Contents pane, or by clicking the "More" dropdown > Tags.

> Tip: Use "Shift" key + click on any page to create two-rivers of tiddlers and read two of them side-by-side! Only works with themes _other than Notebook._
