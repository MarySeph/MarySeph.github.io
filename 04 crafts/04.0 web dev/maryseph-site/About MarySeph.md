## The Site
> [[Update Archive]] | [[Layouts]]

This site is being developed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)-flavored markdown then converted to HTML in VSCode before being uploaded to Neocities.

The site's [source code](https://github.com/MarySeph/Marys-Creative-Corner) and a [page template](https://github.com/MarySeph/Marys-Creative-Corner/blob/main/template.htm) are available on Github for download.

Read the annoyingly long, overly-dramatic and totally unfinished [[Site Manifesto|manifesto]].

### Accessibility
This website has been designed to be responsible on mobile and desktop. See below for potential accessibility issues.

There are some iframes that I'm not sure if they pose an issue. A search didn't give me an answer on that.

**Disclaimer:** I don't use a screen reader or any other type of assistive device to surf the web. If there's any section of this website that is inaccessible, [please drop me a message](https://maryseph.atabook.org/). I'm an indie web dev who's learning about web accessibility and would appreciate the feedback.

#### Stuff to Fix

### Site Plans

- a manifesto for the site's ethos.
- Add notes about responsive web design.
#### Both
- Create Blog with zonelets
- Create Digital Garden

### Credits
A lot of people with their personal website helped me developed this little guy you are reading now. It's not much, but sharing their site is the least I can do. Probably goes without saying that I'm not vouching for the contents of their website.
- [Kalechips](https://kalechips.net/index): [Reader mode template](https://kalechips.net/projects/layouts/) provided the base HTML.
- [Ghost Garden](https://ghostgarden.neocities.org/): table of contents format.
