## Notes:
This is a bag that I have been working on and modifying for about a year. I don't have pictures of the previous version but it's pretty much the pattern I follow with the listed yarn.

The base is made of a granny square which gives it some width.

I had to modify the first version because the thin straps hurt my shoulders. I chose to get some thingies for extra strength. The first ones I used were untreated wood and one broke when thrown in the drier. This version is made with some cheap metal alloy.

I increased the thickness of the straps and added a closure for them. I was imitating the design of my dad's string bag.
